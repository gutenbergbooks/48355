<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This volume of translations is prepared especially for
the use of college sophomores who are studying English
poetry of the fourteenth century, but it is hoped that other
readers may be interested in these old legends. Ideally,
it would be better for students to read the original texts,
but every teacher knows how difficult it is to provide texts
in this field. The various Middle English Readers are not
frankly popular in their choice of subject matter, and the
publications of learned societies are far too expensive to be
available for classroom work. It does not seem, therefore,
entirely an offense against scholarship to offer students a
volume that will serve humbly as companion to "Piers Plowman,"
"The Pearl," Chaucer's poems, and various romances
and lyrics which are studied in carefully edited texts.</p>

<p>The modern translations are literal, but a certain freedom
has been used in reshaping sentences and in omitting conventional
phrases when they proved too monotonous in
their repetitions. Quite enough <em>tags</em> and awkward constructions
have been preserved to illustrate fully the style of
mediæval clerks.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is made for help received from Gaston
Paris's "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La littérature française au moyen âge</span>," and from
W. H. Schofield's "English Literature from the Norman
Conquest to Chaucer." Miss Marion E. Markley has contributed
two translations from Old French, and has given
many helpful suggestions regarding details.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>To create anew the walls and towers and gardens of the
mediæval world is a comparatively easy task, now that we
have so many aids to visualizing that departed age, but it
is not so easy to make live again the thoughts and sentiments
and beliefs of a vanished generation. All our study of history
is valueless unless it brings a clearer revelation of the
pulsing, ardent life of humanity. We search old records
and old literature that we may find the true image of a
world whose hopes and fears and loves prove to us the
slow evolution of a progressive civilization in which all
human beings share. Out of the failures and the doubts
of one age comes the quicker power of another, and true
progress looks both backward and forward. To cherish
old traditions is both a duty and an inspiration.</p>

<p>The reader who turns his face toward the world of mediæval
England and France, seeking to know the spirit
which animated our ancestors of six centuries ago, must
recognize in plowman, hermit, knight, friar, or minstrel
the fundamental fact that their life was actual and real, not
a mere tissue of mediæval costume and mechanical movements.
In order to understand that epoch it is essential
for one to study in detail the works which picture the life
of the day. The world of chivalry, with its brilliant pageantry
and its vows of courtesy, loyalty, and liberality, is revealed
in the pages of Froissart and in the many metrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>romances, where various aspects of knightly life are
described. "King Horn," "Guy of Warwick," "Libeaus
Desconus," "Sir Eglamour," "The Squire of Low
Degree," and others tell the story of knighthood.</p>

<p>Another world is represented in "Piers Plowman," where
the oppression of the poor by the arrogant rich and the
corruption of church and state are described in racy vernacular
by one whose soul was on fire with devotion to truth
and justice. Social problems are enunciated, and the misery
wrought by human ignorance and selfishness is depicted in
satire keen, shrewd, and piercing.</p>

<p>Chaucer, the supreme poet of the fourteenth century in
England, portrays a world of normal folk who represent
all classes and conditions except the very high and the
very low. While, in certain ways, Chaucer's work is easier
to read and understand than that of any of his contemporaries,
students often read it very superficially and fail to
recognize the deeply rooted traits which show that Chaucer
was the child of his epoch. We find in the English poet
traces of the influence of Continental life and literature;
we see him reading the classics of Rome, of Florence, and
of Paris; but he was also always intimately familiar with
the minor literature popular among his own countrymen.</p>

<p>Since an understanding of Chaucer is a vivid introduction
to the later Middle Ages, it is essential for students of
that period to have some acquaintance with the common
literary types of Chaucer's day. The translations gathered
together in this book are representative of these types,—debate,
vision, allegory, saints' legends, pious tales, satire,
and lay. Few examples of secular literature are given, for
the most satisfactory way to approach the secular poetry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>of the time is to read parts, at least, of the "Romance
of the Rose," which has been translated, very freely, by
F. S. Ellis.<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> This long poem is a compendium of the ideals,
manners, and tastes of the fashionable world of France
and of England. The machinery of dream, personification,
and allegory; the descriptions of nature and of dress; the
attitude towards the god of love and his fabled court; the
satire; and the pedantry are all highly significant facts in
the history of literature. Knowing this romance, one knows
the heart of thirteenth century Paris. The Troubadours,<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a>
too, should be studied for the sake of understanding one
side of lyric poetry. All this secular poetry, however, does
not account for Chaucer, who was indebted also to a stream
of influence coming from religious legends and allegories.
The deeper side of his nature responded to the appeal of
pious tales and records of saintly lives; superstitions about
nature and about God attracted his interest, and stirred
him to that effective contemplation which resulted in clear,
sane judgments. Religious poetry was, first and last, familiar
matter to the great court poet, and we should recognize
its characteristics and its sovereign appeal.</p>

<p>We must remember that the world of the Middle Ages
was essentially and positively Catholic. From birth to death
the layman was under the guardianship of Holy Church,
and bound by the most solemn vows to perfect obedience.
Yet, although there seems to be a certain conventionality
in his performance of these duties, there was a very lively
concern regarding that other world toward which he was
moving. Close to the spiritual ecstasy of such lives as that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>Saint Francis, or of Saint Catherine, or of the uncanonized
Richard Rolle, there was a dim, frightened foreboding
that perhaps Evil might prove the triumphant force.
Love of God was no stronger than fear of the devil.
Tales of the black magic of Satan as well as of the white
magic of the church were eagerly listened to by a people
quick to show their interest in any manifestation of the
supernatural. Crude and childish as their faiths and superstitions
may seem to a more liberal age, there is something
impressive in their deep conviction of hidden truths.
When we lose all sense of mystery and of wonder and are
wholly free from any illusions, life becomes singularly vapid,
for the very key to spiritual existence is a sense of infinite
meanings forever challenging, baffling, and dominating
our daily life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"But God forbede but men shulde leve</div>
      <div class="verse">Wel more thing then men han seen with ÿe!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the legends and allegories and satires represented in
these pages the reader will find strange and fervent faiths
as well as homely pictures of the world as it is. A vigorous
use of the concrete is everywhere evident; abstractions
seem not to exist without some physical traits to make
them real to the ordinary man. Intensely picturesque and
objective are the descriptions of hell and of heaven, of the
lands visited by Brandon, of Saint Paul's otter, of the
miracles of Saint Thomas, of the virtues of the coral, and
of the traits of Rose and of Violet. To any readers there
is unending charm in the natural, simple style of setting
forth these details which force vivid conceptions upon the
imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>
<p>Growing up in a world of brilliant court life and becoming
familiar with a literary art which placed emphasis upon
the concrete, Chaucer was inevitably destined to be a supreme
master of specific, suggestive realism. He loved
every aspect of existence, and he wrought his descriptions
with an art precise and joyous. The French poets and
the English preachers taught him the secret of appealing
to the popular love of visible and audible images. Yet
his greatest power is that dramatic portrayal of human
experience, a presentation whose quick humour and overflowing
sympathy have made him beloved by generations.
Impatient of affectation in art, in manner, or in spiritual
matters, he taught sincerity. His humour, poise, and fearless,
keen mentality will always have their healing and
wonder-working qualities.</p>

<h3 title="OF MAN'S BODY">OF MAN'S BODY<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a></h3>

<p>As I said before, the King of Might would be worshipped
by two kinds of beings, angel and man. Adam
was created, therefore, to make the tenth order, which
Lucifer tried to destroy. Adam was not made of earth
alone, but of four elements: his blood of water, his flesh
of earth, his heat of fire, and his breath of air. His head
has two eyes. The sky has sun and moon that, as men
know, are set for sight; so man's eyes serve as sun and
moon of light. Seven chief stars are fixed in heaven, and
man's head has seven holes, which, if you think about it,
you may find with little labor. This breath that man draws
so often betokens the wind that blows aloft, of which
thunder and lightning are created, as breath is bred in
the breast with a cough. All waters sink into the sea, so
man's stomach drinks all liquors. His feet bear him up
from falling, as the earth upholds all things. The upper
fire gives man his sight, the upper air his power of hearing,
the under wind gives him his breath, the earth gives
him his taste, feeling, and touch; the hardness of bone
that man has comes to him from the nature of stones.
From the earth grow trees and grass; and from man's
flesh, nails and hair. With dumb beasts man has his share
of things which he likes ill or well. Of these things, I
have heard said, Adam's body was put together. For this
reason that you have heard, man is called the lesser world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<h3>OF MAN'S SOUL</h3>

<p>But you have not yet heard the story of how man's soul
was wrought. A ghostly light man says it is that God has
made in His likeness; as print of a seal is fixed in wax,
so man has God's likeness. He has wrought him as friend
and companion, since nothing is so dear to Him. His
Godhead is the Trinity, so a soul has properly three powers:
the perception of what is, was, and shall be. It has
pure understanding of what is seen and is unseen; it has,
also, wisdom of will to take the good and leave the evil. All
the powers that may be dwell in that Holy Trinity. That
soul which is cleansed from sin has all virtues. As God,
who is one and three, may by no kind of creature be understood
nor overtaken, but He overtakes each one, so the
soul, without spot, is unseen, though it has sight of all
things. To see the soul you have no power. Now have I
shown you how two things hold man together;—the soul,
a thing spiritual, and the body, which is flesh and skin.</p>

<h3 title="THE PLEADING OF THE ROSE AND OF THE VIOLET">THE PLEADING OF THE ROSE AND OF
THE VIOLET<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a></h3>


<p>In the presence of Imagination, before whom in due
course of law actions are brought, an argument was one
day commenced between the Rose and the Violet. The
matter, of which I treat, was most wisely conducted. To
set forth fully points, process, articles, and case, the advocate
of the Rose appeared first and began as follows:</p>

<p>"Violet! I am here to propound a question in behalf
of my lady, lovely Rose; I hereby announce to you, and
intend likewise to proclaim and sustain in all courts of
the land, that Rose is of greater worth, more desired, and
more dearly esteemed than you are. That is just, for indeed
she adorns the season with her color, more delicate
than purple and crimson, and with her sweet fragrance.
She lasts much longer in her beauty than do you, Violet;
and, red or white, she springs in the pleasant month of
May to draw all lovers out of their sadness. Then do ladies
and youths, lords, bachelors and maidens gather her flowers,
some making chaplets of them and others weaving garlands
to adorn themselves."</p>

<p>At this point, the advocate of the Violet, who was very
old, could no longer keep silent, and broke in:</p>

<p>"O God! If I did not know how to speak, I might
have to withdraw from this argument, but, if it please God,
I shall speak, and I shall support the cause of Violet
against Rose. Sir Advocate, I say and affirm, in spite of
your speech, that Violet is more joyfully welcomed, more
beloved, and more desired than Rose. Here is the cause;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>now listen to the truth. When a winter full of frost and
chill shall have put to rout, by its prolonged stay, trees
and fruits, leaves and flowers, then men and women and
children long for bright days, and wish the springtime to
come swiftly, when they will hear the singing of larks and
will find violets in orchards, gardens, and every pretty
close. There youths and maidens gather them and make
gay chaplets, and many put them under their pillows
in token of delight and pleasure. And when this sweet
and fresh season of spring comes anew, you may see many
people fastening violets in fresh green sprays of gooseberry,
and arranging them so as to set off their beauty
and fragrance. To speak truly, Sir Advocate, one cannot
do them too much honor. Now, I pray you, sit down; for
I would rest a little. But I will take up the argument again,
if, indeed, there be any further need of my services."</p>

<p>Each of the advocates seated himself, and Imagination set
a day for their return, for she wished to hear them further.</p>


<p><i>Here follows how the Advocate of the Rose sets
forth her Cause</i></p>

<p>Now they have come to the appointed day; may it
dawn happily, for I would hear most gladly the order of
their discourse. The advocate of the Rose spoke first, for
he was well versed in speaking, and he addressed them
as follows:</p>

<p>"Before Imagination, who is my sovereign lady, I here
make protest and vigorous complaint against the grievous
charges with which Violet oppresses us. When she wishes
to detract from the power of the Rose, white and red,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>she shows little discrimination, and her advocate likewise,
for as black differs from white so it is clear the Violet
differs from the Rose. I do not know who is counselling
this advocate, but certainly he is not endowed with good
judgment; or if he is, it does not appear in this case.
Now, to silence him completely I will give some details,
that he may take counsel of them. First of all, I will
compare the red rose, by figure, to the sun, for the round
sun, when we see it rising at morning and setting at night,
is in color not at all variegated, but sanguine indeed, and
deep red as the red rose. There are yet further considerations
why one should greatly honor the Rose. You know
that there are two kinds of grapes, from which are made
white wine and red, and with these wines the holy sacrament
is solemnly celebrated. I choose the white rose to
stand for the white wine, and for red wine the red rose.
Indeed, they still cry in the streets, 'Come buy the good
wine <em>Rosette</em>.' Roses, white and red, have mysterious and
agreeable virtue, for from them is made a liquid, called
rose water, that is good for healthy folk, and necessary for
those that are ill, because it assuages strong fevers. It is
refreshing to the face, and to the mouth and the hands.
Many, indeed, wish their pillows, be it for sleeping or
waking, may be scented with the fragrance of the Rose.
Consider where the Rose dwells. I call the rose-bush her
house. God set her there, in all reason, not shut up in a
tower, but enclosed about with sharp thorns so that the
young goats that love to pasture on violets and nibble the
leaves and tender shoots shall not touch roses nor buds."</p>

<p>With this, the advocate for the Rose was silent, having
reviewed wisely and well, it seemed, the case of the Rose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>red and white. The court adjourned for a little, until there
was great impatience to know if the advocate of the Violet,
having heard the case for lovely Rose, would return to
the debate. Truly, you shall hear how he responded with
much wisdom. But I must write down his replies before
I can recite them.</p>


<p><i>Here follows how the Advocate of the Violet
sustains her Cause</i></p>

<p>"O Advocate for Violet, come forward, for they bring
points of opposition against you," said Imagination, "and
you will have to make reply to them, unless I am to dismiss
the case."</p>

<p>The advocate answered, "Lady, I am all ready, by my
soul, to reply, and to do my duty, and to show that I have
spoken truth. First of all, I state, in plain prose, that I
do not doubt the Rose may be beautiful and good and
wise and may have many ways and uses that are much to
be commended; but I should like to ask her advocate if
his figure of the sun is acceptable or quite truthful. The
Rose is cool and moist, the sun hot; now, in this point,
his argument is false. However, let that count for what it
may. My sword is as sharpened for all thrusts as his. He
is foolish who evades his opponent when he can attack
him. I have both occasion and motive for challenging
him, and so I do it. He has just now compared the Rose
to the sun; I assure him that I will not, by a still worse
figure, compare violets to the stars or the planets. I will
not strain his comparison farther, for that would be foolish.
But I will name them daughters of the round firmament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>for they have her own color, without white, black, red, or
green. When clouds came down from the heavens, the
earth drank in their moisture and conceived violets, so she
holds them in deep affection. Blue signifies steadfastness;
he or she who wears it, remember, must have a heart
always firm and steadfast and strengthened. Violets are
flowers of good worth, fair to see and to wear. When
ladies and maidens have fine gowns or rich hangings for
their beds, if they scent them with violets people will say,
'This robe is sweet,' and will enjoy the odor. Violets, dear
masters, have further power and virtue, which strengthens
my argument and overthrows all your specious comments.</p>

<p>"Take violets and roses, and, to test their power, throw
them into brandy, to see what will happen and what will
become of their odor. The brandy, which is powerful, will
take away substance and vigor from the lovely Rose, while
the Violet will persist in its fragrance; this is certain. So
I hold her, and with reason, to be of far greater importance
and of much nobler quality than the Rose. Furthermore,
there is made from violets a good lotion which gives
comfort to sick people, and from the plants and roots are
made several medicines, but you cannot make anything
out of a rose-bush, except a fire in winter. And if goats or
sheep do browse on violets, I am sure that the milk they
give does much good to the children who drink it."</p>

<p>Then Master Papin, the advocate of the Rose, stood up
and wished to say something, but Imagination spoke before
him, and said, "Where are you going, Sir Advocate? You
weary us with so much talking. Who wants to listen to
your speeches? They would fill four rolls. We must stop
your pleading, for we are compelled to hear other cases."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>"Lady," said the advocate, "you ought to hear all suits
out; for that is your court open. Do not be so hasty;
you complain of the debate too soon. Pronounce your
just decision on our case."</p>

<p>Imagination, at these words, declared that she would
hear no more, nor would she give a decision.</p>

<p>"Who will then? Tell us that, Lady!"</p>

<p>"Willingly," she replied; "you have elsewhere a court
of appeal for judging right and wrong, which is higher
than mine."</p>

<p>"And where is it? Lead us to it, or direct us, and we
will go there."</p>

<p>Imagination replied, "Good sir Advocate, the noble and
high Fleur-de-lys, whom men should hold in dear esteem,
has sovereignty, has she not, over the Rose and all other
flowers? Indeed she has and always has had and shall
have, as is just; for as the lion is king of beasts and the
eagle king of birds, so, I assure you, is the Fleur-de-lys sovereign
lady over all flowers, and most exalted. Therefore
go to her court,—happy is he who has recourse to it,—I
cannot send you to a better place to plead your cause.
The way is not very long; say that I sent you there for
counsel, that they may help you."</p>

<p>"Ah, dear lady, and where does the Fleur-de-lys live?
Since this is so, we will go there, if it please you."</p>

<p>She responds, without hesitation, "In the noble realm
of France. There you will find with all delight the noble
and high Fleur-de-lys surrounded in state by a fair and
goodly company: Hardihood, Youth, Wisdom, Honor,
and Largesse, by whom you will be welcomed gladly and
advised with counsel gracious and wise. For the King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Orleans and Bourbon, Berry, Bourgoyne, Eu, and La
Marche will not break their promise to study wisely, to
consider loyally, and to examine your dispute, which will
be pleasing to them. And when they have heard it, I believe
that they will answer so wisely and so to the point
that there will never be more argument between Rose and
Violet such as this plea deals with. And if, through any
difficulty in the affair, it should be necessary to have counsel,
you know there are still the Marguerites, small and
beautiful flowers, whom it is a pleasure to meet again at
all seasons, summer and winter, and there are several other
noble flowers, with which her court is much adorned, who
may give her faithful counsel. Go there, I advise you."</p>

<p>"Lady," said he, "that is our purpose." With that the
hearing was closed.</p>

<h3 title="THE PURGATORY OF SAINT PATRICK">THE PURGATORY OF SAINT PATRICK<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a></h3>


<p>Saint Patrick felt such pity for the Irish folk, who lived
in deadly sin and false belief, that he constantly besought
them to turn to God and obey His law, but they were so
full of wickedness that they scorned every word he spoke.
They all said that they would not repent nor cease from
evil unless he would undertake the adventure of going
down into hell to bring them back tidings of the pain and
woe which souls suffer there evermore. The saint was
sorely dismayed upon hearing this, and, often, with fasting
and prayer, he begged Jesus Christ to grant him the grace
to find a way by which he might bring the people of Ireland
out of bondage to the fiend, and lead them to believe
in God Omnipotent.</p>

<p>Once, while he was in holy church, praying thus, he
fell asleep before the altar, and began to dream of heaven's
bliss; he thought that Jesus came to him and gave him a
book such as no clerk can ever write, telling all manner of
good tidings of heaven and earth and hell, and of God's
mystery. Into his hand God put a fair staff, which to this
day is called, in Ireland, God's staff. And God led him
straightway thence into a great desert where was a secret
opening, grisly to see. Round it was, and black; in all
the world it has no mate. When Saint Patrick saw that
sight he was greatly troubled in his sleep, but God revealed
to him that if a man who had sinned against the holy law
and yet truly repented should do penance in this hole, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>day and a night, his sins would be forgiven him. If the
man were of good faith, steadfast in belief, he should see
the strong pains of those who have sinned in this world,
but should not suffer himself, and finally, he should behold
the joy that lasts for aye in paradise. Then Jesus withdrew
his gracious countenance and left Patrick there alone.</p>

<p>When the saint awoke he found God's tokens, and, taking
them in his hand, he knelt to thank Jesus Christ for
revealing to him how he might turn the Irish folk to
amendment. On that spot, without delay, he had a fair
abbey built, in the name of God and of our Lady. The abbey
had no equal anywhere; solace and glee and rejoicing
abounded for poor and for rich. White canons regular
were placed there to serve God early and late and to be
holy men. The book and the staff God gave him men may
still see. In the east end of the abbey is that grisly hole,
with a good stone wall all around it, and a gate with lock
and key. That very spot is called the right entrance to
Patrick's Purgatory, for in the times when this happened
many a man went down to hell, as the story tells us, and
suffered pain for his trespasses, and then returned again,
through God's grace. They all said, when they had come
out, that they had indeed seen the very pains of hell and
also the joys of angels singing to God and to his hosts.
That is the joy of paradise: Jesus bring us thither!
When the people of Ireland began to understand the joys
described by Saint Patrick, they all came to him and were
christened at the font and forsook their misdeeds. So
they became good Christians through knowledge of God
and the prayers of Saint Patrick. Now hearken, and I
will tell you about another thing, if you care to hear it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>In the days of Stephen, a king who ruled England
wisely, there was in Northumberland a knight who was a
brave and valiant man. He was born in that country, and
was called Owain. He knew much about battle, and he
was very sinful towards his Creator. One day, bethinking
himself of his sins, he was filled with dread, and he determined,
through God's grace, to be shriven and sin no
more. By chance, he came to the Bishop of Ireland, in
that abbey where the hole of penance was, and he confessed
and prayed that a sore penance be laid upon him,
for never again, he said, would he sin. The bishop was
glad of this promise, and, after rebuking Owain sharply
for his evil deeds, said that he must undertake many hard
tasks of penance. The knight answered, "Gladly will I
do what God ordains, though it be to go into Patrick's
Purgatory." The bishop, describing to him the torments
of the place, said, "Nay, friend Owain, that way thou
shalt not go. Take some other penance in expiation of
thy sins." However, for all the bishop could say the
knight would not yield, so the bishop led him into the
holy church and taught him the law of God.</p>

<p>Fifteen days he spent in affliction, in fasting, and in
prayer, and then the prior, at the head of a procession
with cross and banner, brought him to the hole. The
prior said, "Knight Owain, here is thy way, go right forward;
when thou hast proceeded a long distance and hast
lost the light of day, still keep directly north. Thou shalt
go thus under the earth, and then, very soon, thou wilt
find a great field where there is a hall of stone, unlike any
other in the world. Some light there is, but no more than
appears when the sun goes to ground in winter. Into that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>hall thou shalt go and stay until folk come to solace thee.
Thirteen<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> men will appear, all serjeants of God, and they
will counsel thee about thy course through purgatory."</p>

<p>Then the prior and the convent commended him to God
and went forth, shutting the gate. The knight took the
way leading to the field where was the hall of stone. The
hall was the work of no earthly workman; it was cleverly
made in fashion of a cloister, with pillars on each side.
When the knight had stood a long time, marvelling, he
entered. Soon, thirteen wise men appeared, all dressed in
white habits and with their heads newly tonsured. Their
leader, advancing, saluted the knight, and then sat down
to instruct him: "I shall counsel thee, dear brother, as I
have many another who has passed this way, to be of good
faith, certain, and without doubt, for thou wilt see, when
we have departed, a thousand fiends and more to lead
thee to torment; take note that if thou dost obey them
in the slightest thing, thy soul will be lost. Keep God in
thy heart, and think how He suffered from His wounds.
Unless thou dost as I tell thee, thou wilt go to hell, body
and soul, and be lost eternally. If thou dost speak God's
high name, they cannot harm thee." When he had thus
counselled the knight, the leader and his fellows commended
him to God, and with benign looks went forth
from the hall.</p>

<p>Owain, left there in dread, began to lament and call
upon God. Soon he heard a piteous cry; he could not
have been more frightened if the heaven had fallen. When
he had recovered from the fear caused by that cry, there
came flocking in a crowd of fiends, fifty score or more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>loathsome things altogether. Crowding around the knight
they laughed him to scorn, saying that he had come in
flesh and skin to win the joys of hell forever. The master
fiend, falling upon his knees, said, "Welcome, Owain;
thou art come to suffer penance for thy sins, but thou
wilt get no benefit, for thou shalt have torments, hard
and strong and tough enough because of thy deadly sins.
Never hadst thou more mischance than thou shalt have
in our dance when we begin our sport. However, if thou
wilt do our bidding, since thou art dear to us, our whole
company will bring thee back with tender love to the spot
where thou didst leave the prior. If thou dost refuse, we
shall prove to thee that thou hast served us many a year
in pride and luxury, and all our company will thrust their
hooks at thee." Owain answered, "I forsake your counsel,
and will endure my penance." When the fiends heard this,
they made a great fire in the hall, and binding him fast,
feet and hands, they cast him into the midst of it. He
called upon our Lord, and at once the fire vanished; no
coal nor spark was left, through the grace of God Almighty.
As soon as the knight saw this he grew bolder, realizing
that it was the treachery of the fiends to try his heart.</p>

<p>Then the devils went out of the hall, leading the knight
with them to a strange place, where nothing good entered,
only hunger, thirst, and cold. He could see no tree, could
hear no sound of wind, yet a cold blast blew that pierced
his side. At last the fiends brought him to a valley where
the knight thought he must have reached the deepest pit
of hell. As he drew nearer, he looked about, for he heard
screaming and groaning, and he saw a field full of men
and women, each lying face downward, naked, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>deadly wounds. They lay prone on the earth, bound with
iron bands, screaming and wailing, "Alas, alas, mercy,
mercy, mercy, God Almighty!" Mercy there was none,
but only sorrow of heart and grinding of teeth, which was
a grisly sight. That sorrow and misery is punishment for
the foul sin of sloth. Whosoever is slow in God's service
may expect to lie in purgatory in such torment.</p>

<p>That was the first pain that they inflicted on him, and
after he had recovered, they took him to a place where he
saw more misery. Men and women crying out, "Alas!"
and "Welaway!" lay there, faces upward, as the others had
lain with faces downward, with feet and hands and heads
nailed fast to the earth with nails glowing red. Owain saw
loathsome fiery dragons sitting upon them; on others sat
black toads, newts, adders, and snakes that ate them, backs
and sides. This is the punishment of gluttony; for the
love of God be warned, since that sin flourishes all too
widely. Owain thought a wind blew among them so bitter
and so cold that it overthrew all who lay in purgatory. The
fiends quickly leaped upon the sufferers and tore them
furiously with their hooks. Whosoever, man or woman,
is guilty of impurity in this life, shall suffer in that prison.
The fiend said to the knight, "Thou hast been unclean and
a great glutton, also; into this torment thou shalt be thrust
unless thou wilt return speedily the way thou didst come."
Owain said, "Nay, Satan, further still shall I go, through
the grace of God Almighty." The fiends would have seized
him, but he called upon God Omnipotent, and they lost
all their power.</p>

<p>They then led him into a spot where men never did
any good deeds, but only shameful and villainous ones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>In the fourth field this was, full of torments. There were
people hanging by the feet from burning iron hooks, others
hung by the neck, the stomach, the back, and in other
ways too numerous to mention. Some were hanging by
the tongue, and their constant cry was "Alas!" and no
other prayer. In a furnace with molten lead and burning
brimstone boiling over the fire were many folk. Some
lying on gridirons glowing against the flames were people
whom Owain had once known, but who were now entirely
changed through the penance they suffered. A wild fire
surged among them, and all whom it seized, it burned,
ten thousand souls and more. Those that hung by feet
and neck were thieves, or the companions of thieves, and
wrought men woe. Those that hung by the tongue and ever
sang "Alas!" and cried so loudly were backbiters in their
lives. Beware, man or wife, if thou art fond of chiding!
All the places the knight came by were full of the pains
of purgatory. Whosoever takes the name of God in vain,
or bears any false witness, suffers strong pains there.</p>

<p>Owain saw where a grisly-looking wheel turned; huge
it was, burning like a brand as it wound around, and covered
with hooks. A hundred thousand souls and more
were hanging from the wheel. The fiends turned it about
so fast that Sir Owain could not recognize anybody there.
Out of the earth came a burning blue fire; it smelled
foully, and it went around the wheel, burning the souls to
a very fine powder. The wheel that runs thus is for the
punishment of covetousness that now reigns everywhere.
The covetous man has never enough gold or silver or
even ploughs until Death fells him. The fiends said to
the knight, "Thou hast been covetous of winning land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>and men; upon this wheel thou shalt be placed unless
thou wilt return at once to thine own country." When he
refused, the fiends seized him, bound him fast upon the
revolving wheel, and cast him in the midst. When the
hooks tore him and the fire burned him, he thought of
Jesus Christ. An angel bore him from the wheel, and all
the fiends there could do him no harm.</p>

<p>Further he was led in great pain, until they came to a
mountain that was red as blood. Men and women stood
on it, in misery, it seemed, for they cried as if they were
mad. The fiends then said to the knight, "Thou art wondering
about these men who make such doleful cheer.
They have deserved the wrath of God; soon they shall
have such a drink as they will not think pleasant." No
sooner had he spoken than there came a blast of wind
that took fiends and souls and knight up almost into the
firmament, and then cast them down into a foul-smelling
river that ran under the mountain of fire as an arrow from
a cross-bow. It was as cold as ice, and no one can describe
the pain that he suffered. Owain was almost drowned in
the water, and became so frenzied and faint that he was
well-nigh lost. As soon as he could think upon God he
was brought out of the water and carried to land. That
pain is the punishment of wrath and envy. Envy was the
blast of wind which cast him into the smelling water. Let
every man beware of it.</p>

<p>They led him forth quickly until they came to a hall
whose like he had never seen before; out of the hall came
such heat that the knight began to sweat. He saw so foul
a smoke that he stopped, and when the fiends perceived
it they were pleased. "Turn again," they began to cry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>"thou shalt die, unless thou dost withdraw." When he
came to the hall door he saw misery, a half of which he
had never imagined. The hall was a place of torments;
those folk who were in that prison were stripped of all
happiness, for the floor of the hall was full of pits, round
and filled to the top with brimstone, brass, copper, and
other metals all molten. Men and women stood in these,
screaming and crying as if they were mad; some stood up
to the waist, others to the breast, and some to the chin.
Each man according to his guilt was fixed in that torment,
to suffer that great heat. Some bore around their necks
bags full of pennies glowing with fire, and such meat they
ate. These were usurers in this life. Beware, men and
women, lest such sin hinder you. And many souls there
walked upright, bearing false measures and false weights,
which fiends sat upon. The fiends said to the knight,
"Thou must bathe in this lead before thou go hence;
because of thy usury and thy sin, thou must wash thyself
somewhat." Owain feared that torment, and called upon
God Omnipotent and His mother Mary. He was borne
out of the hall, from the pains and all the fiends, when
he made that outcry.</p>

<p>Soon he was frightened by seeing a flame of fire, mighty
and thick, spring out of the earth, like coal and pitch. Of
seven colors was this fire, and some of the souls burning
in it were yellow, some green, some black, some blue, and
some like adders. They were woful indeed. The fiends
took the knight to the pit, and said, "Now, Owain, thou
mayst find solace, for thou shalt shake with our fellows
in the pit of hell. These are our birds in our cage, and
this is our court and our castle tower. Dost thou think,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Sir Knight, that to those who are brought here anything is
sharp? Now turn again, ere it be too late, before we thrust
thee into hell gate, for thou shalt never issue out of it by
means of any crying or calling upon Mary, or by any
other trick." The knight was firm, so the fiends seized
and bound him, and cast him far down into that dark,
evil, reeking prison. The farther down they thrust him
the hotter it was, and he suffered cruelly. With good will
and steadfast heart he called upon God Omnipotent to help
him out of that torment, and he was borne up out of the
pit, otherwise he would have been lost until the day of his
death. That suffering, which lasts forever, is for the foul
sin of pride.</p>

<p>Outside the pit he realized how God had rescued him.
His clothes were torn to pieces, his body was burned all
over, and he knew not which way to go. He changed color
when he saw more fiends, none of whom he recognized in
that strange place. Some of them had sixty eyes that were
loathsome and grisly, some had sixty hands. They said,
"Thou shalt not be alone, but shalt have us for company,
to teach thee the new laws, as before thou didst learn them
in that spot where thou wast among our fellows." The
fiends then led the knight towards a foul-smelling body
of water, such as he had never seen. It was many miles
in breadth and black as pitch. Owain saw passing over it
a very strong but narrow bridge. The fiends said, "Lo,
Sir Knight, seest thou this? This is the bridge of paradise;
across this thou must go, and we shall hurl stones
at thee, and the wind shall blow thee over and work thee
woe. Thou wilt never pass over this without falling into
the midst of our fellows to dwell forevermore. When thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>hast fallen down, then all our company will come and
wound thee with their hooks. We shall teach thee a new
sport, for thou hast served us many a day, and we will lead
thee into hell."</p>

<p>Owain beheld the bridge and the water under it, so black
and dreadful, and began to be sore afraid because of one
thing he noted: never did motes dance in the sunbeam
thicker than that company of fiends. The bridge<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> was as
high as a tower and as sharp as a razor; narrow it was,
and the water running underneath burned with lightning
and thunder. He was exceedingly woful. There is no
clerk who may write with ink, nor no man who can think,
nor no master who can divine, one half of the torment
there is under the bridge of paradise. We are told that
there is the true entrance to hell. Saint Paul bears witness.
Whosoever falls down from the bridge will never
have redemption in any degree.</p>

<p>The fiends then said to the knight, "There is no need
for thee to cross this bridge. Flee pain, sorrow, and woe,
and we will lead thee fairly back to that place from which
thou didst come." Owain began to recall from how many
of the tricks of the fiends God had saved him, so he set
his foot upon the bridge, and felt no sharp edge, nor was
he at all afraid. When the fiends saw that he was more
than half over, they began to cry aloud, "Alas, alas, that
he was born, this knight we have lost from our prison!"</p>

<p>When he was safely across the bridge, he thanked God
Omnipotent and His mother Mary, who had sent him such
grace, that he was delivered out of torment into a better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>region. A cloth of gold was brought to him, he knew not
how except that God sent it. That cloth he put on, and
at once all his wounds from being burned were whole,
and he thanked the Trinity. Looking ahead, he saw what
seemed to be a stone wall. He gazed far and near, but
could see no end of this, which shone all of red gold.
Farther on he saw a gate, a fairer one may never be in
this world. It was made, not of wood nor of steel, but of
red gold and of precious stones, created by God out of
nothing. Jasper, topaz, crystal, pearls, and coral, rich
sapphires, rubies, chalcedonies, onyxes, and diamonds
were wrought into tabernacles. Richer they might not
be; they had pillars small and beautifully fashioned, with
arches of carbuncles, knots of red gold, and pinnacles of
crystal. Inasmuch as our Savior is more skilful than any
goldsmith or painter in any land, so are the gates of paradise
more richly wrought than any other.</p>

<p>The gates unfastened themselves, and a fragrance like
balm came forth, of such sweetness that the knight took
fresh strength and thought that now he would be a thousand
times better prepared to suffer pain and woe and to
fight against all the fiends if he had to go back the way
he came. He went near the gate and saw approaching a
procession of folk with gracious countenances, bearing
tapers and candlesticks of gold and crosses and banners.
Popes there were, of great dignity, and many cardinals,
kings and queens, knights, abbots superior, monks, canons,
and preaching friars, and bishops who bore crosses. Minorite
friars and Jacobins, Carmelites and Austin friars, black
and white nuns—all manner of religious orders went in that
procession. The order of wedlock came also, with many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>men and women who thanked God for sending his grace
to deliver the knight from torment by the fiends, and to
bring him alive to that spot. When the praises had thus
been sung, two archbishops came out of the midst of that
company, bearing palms of gold. They advanced to the
knight, and, taking him between them, led him up and
down, and showed him still greater joys and also much
melody. Merry were their carols of joy and minstrelsy.
They went carolling with a joy no man can divine, singing
and praising God; angels guided them with harps and
fiddles and psaltery, and bells rang merrily. No man may
carol there except him who is clean from sin and who has
given up all folly. Now may God and His mother Mary,
in memory of Thy wounds, grant that we may carol in
that hall. This same joy is granted for love and charity
towards God and all mankind. Whosoever lets earthly
love alone and loves God in Trinity may carol thus.</p>

<p>Other joys he saw in abundance: high trees, with many
branches, on which the birds of heaven sat and sang their
notes with merry glee, some low, some intermediate, and
some high. He thought indeed that with the song of
those birds he might live happily there until the end of
the world. Then he saw the tree of life, because of which
Adam and his wife went to hell. Fair were the arbors,
there, with flowers,—roses and lilies of many colors,
primroses and periwinkle, mint, featherfoy and eglantine,
columbine, and many others, more than man can think.
Herbs of other kinds than on earth grow there, though
that is the least of the praises of the place. Forever they
spring up green, sweeter than licorice, unchanging in
winter and summer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>There are wells in that spot, with water sweeter than
any mead, and out of the chief one which Owain saw, run
the four streams of paradise. Pison, they call one stream
that gleams brightly, because men find gold there; Gihon
is another that is much praised for the precious stones in
its bed; the third stream is named Euphrates, it runs
straight along; and the fourth is Tigris, in all the world
is there none other with stones so bright. Whosoever
loves to live in purity shall have that same bliss and see
that same sight. More Owain saw there, under God's
glory on high; blessed be His might!</p>

<p>Some souls he saw apart by themselves, and some in
groups of ten or twelve; and when they met together they
made as much rejoicing as sister does with brother. Some
he saw going about in scarlet red, some in purple well
wrought, and others in thin silk. They wore tunics and
albs, like what the priest wears at mass, some covered with
gold work. The knight knew well by their clothing in what
state they were, and what deeds they had done when they
were men's companions. I will tell you a fair similitude
drawn from the clear stars; inasmuch as one star is
brighter to the sight and of more power than three others,
so is it with the joys of paradise. They are not all alike,
yet he who has the least joy thinks he has the most of all
and calls himself very rich.</p>

<p>The bishops came again and, taking him between them,
led him up and down and said, "Brother, God be praised,
thy wish is fulfilled. Now listen to our counsel. Thou hast
seen with thine eyes both the joys and the pains. We will
tell thee ere thou dost pass hence, of our common fate.
That land that is so full of sorrow, evening and morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>where thou as well as many other souls didst suffer
sorely, is called by men purgatory. And this land, where
thou now art, so wide and spacious and so full of bliss, is
called paradise. No man may come here until he has been
purged and made clean there. When they come hither,
we lead them into joy, sometimes by groups of twelve and
ten. And some are so bound, that they know not how long
they must endure the heat; but if their friends who are left
on earth have masses sung, or else give food or some other
kind of alms, all the better will these folk speed and will
come out of their misery into this paradise, where joy and
bliss ever are, and will live here in perfect peace. Just as
they come out of purgatory, so pass we on to God's glory,
which is the high kingdom of the celestial paradise, wherein
enter only Christian folk to a joy unequalled. When we
come out of the fire of purgatory we cannot pass at once into
that place nor see God's face, but must dwell here a long
time. Even the child born tonight must pass through that
pain before he can enter heaven, and how much harder is
it for an old man who has been long in sin to come hither!"</p>

<p>Forth they went until they saw a very high mountain
where all was pleasure. Finally they came to the top, and
saw all its joys. There were all manner of bird songs;
much delight was there and evermore shall be. There is
more joy in a bird's mouth than in any harp or fiddle or
crouth,<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> whether on land or sea. That land so fair is called
the terrestrial paradise; the other paradise, which is the
kingdom of God, is above the air and has joys unequalled.
(In the earthly paradise Owain was, which Adam had lost,
and if Adam had done according to the will of God, neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>he nor his offspring would have had to depart out of that
joy. Yet, since Adam broke God's commandment so soon,
God made him delve with pick and spade in the earth, to
help his wife and himself. God was very wroth with him.
An angel of stern countenance, bearing a sword of fire,
came and made them sore afraid, and drove them out into
the world, where they lived evermore in sorrow and woe.
And when he died he came to hell, as did all his descendants,
until the Son of God was born, by whose passion and
death man was brought out of that prison.)<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a></p>

<p>The bishops commanded the knight to tell them whether
heaven seemed white or gray, blue or red, yellow or green.
The knight answered, "Methinks it is a thousand times
brighter than any gold." "Yet," said the bishop, "that
very place which is so bright is only the entrance, and
every day, to make us blithe, we are refreshed by a sweet
fragrance, which is food to our soul." Anon the knight
was aware that a flame of fire issued out from heaven's
gate, and he thought that it flew all over paradise, giving
forth a sweet smell. The Holy Ghost, in form of fire,
alighted then upon the knight, by whose virtue he lost all
his earthliness; and for this he thanked God's grace.</p>

<p>Then the bishop said, "God feeds us each day with
His bread, but we have no such knowledge of His grace,
nor such a vision of His face as have those who are on
high. The souls who are at God's feast have joy that lasts
without end. Now thou, because of our common fate,
must return again the way thou didst come. Keep thyself
from mortal sin, so that when thou art dead thou mayst
be led by angels into the joy that has no end."</p>

<p>Then Owain wept bitterly and prayed for God's mercy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>that he might dwell there and might not behold again the
strong pains of hell. From his prayer he got no gain; so
he took his leave and departed, although he was very sorrowful.
Fiends he saw—ten thousand flying from him fast
as arrows from a cross-bow. When he came to the hall
he found the thirteen men therein. They all held up their
hands, and thanked the mercy of Jesus Christ a thousand
times and more, and bade Owain not to rest until he had
returned to Ireland as quickly as he could go. And, as I
find in the story, the prior of the purgatory had a token
that night that Owain had overcome his woes and would
appear on the morrow, through grace of God Almighty.</p>

<p>Then the prior, at the head of a procession with cross
and banner, went at once to the hole where Owain had
gone, and soon they saw a gleam of light like a bright fire
burning; then in the midst of the light came Owain, the
knight of God. Then they knew well that Owain had
been in paradise and in purgatory, and that he was a holy
man. They led him into holy church, to do God's office
and to say his prayers. On the fifteenth day, the knight
took staff and scrip and sought the holy place where Christ
bought us so dearly upon the cross and where He rose
from death to life through the virtue of His five wounds.
Blessed may He be! And Bethlehem, too, he visited,
where Christ was born of Mary, His mother like the flower
of the thorn. At last, returning to Ireland, Owain took the
monk's habit and lived there seven years. When he died
he entered, truly, into the high joys of paradise, through
the help of God's grace. Now for the love of Saint Owain,
may God grant us the bliss of heaven above, in the presence
of His sweet face! Amen!</p>

<h3 title="THE LIFE OF SAINT BRANDON">THE LIFE OF SAINT BRANDON<a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a></h3>


<p>Saint Brandon, the holy man, was a monk and born in
Ireland, and there he was abbot of a house wherein were
a thousand monks, and there he had a full strait and
holy life in great penance and abstinence, and he governed
his monks full virtuously. And then within short while
after there came to him an holy abbot, that hight Birinus,
to visit him, and each of them was joyful of other. And
then Saint Brandon began to tell to the Abbot Birinus of
many wonders that he had seen in divers lands, and when
Birinus heard that of Saint Brandon, he began to sigh and
sore weep, and Saint Brandon comforted him in the best
wise that he could, saying, "Ye come hither for to be
joyful with me, and therefore for God's love leave your
mourning, and tell me what marvels ye have seen in the
great sea ocean that compasseth all the world about and
all other waters come out of him, which runneth in all
parts of the earth."</p>

<p>And then Birinus began to tell to Saint Brandon and to
his monks the marvels that he had seen, full sore weeping,
and said: "I have a son, his name is Mervok, and
he was a monk of great fame, which had great desire to
seek about by ship in divers countries to find a solitary
place wherein he might dwell secretly out of the business
of the world for to serve God quietly with more devotion.
And I counselled him to sail into an island far in the sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>beside the Mountain of Stones, which is full well known;
and then he made him ready and sailed thither with his
monks. And when he came thither he liked the place full
well, where he and his monks served our Lord full devoutly."</p>

<p>And then Birinus saw in a vision that this monk Mervok
was sailed right far eastward in the sea, more than
three days' sailing, and suddenly, to his seeming, there
came a dark cloud and over-covered them, that a great
part of the day they saw no light, and, as our Lord would,
the cloud passed away and they saw a full fair island, and
thitherward they drew. In that island was joy and mirth
enough, and the earth of that island shined as bright as
the sun; and there were the fairest trees and herbs that
ever any man saw, and there were many precious stones
shining bright, and every herb there was full of flowers,
and every tree full of fruit, so that it was a glorious sight
and a heavenly joy to abide there.</p>

<p>And then there came to them a fair young man, and
full courteously he welcomed them all, and called every
monk by his name, and he said that they were much bound
to praise the name of our Lord Jesu, that would, of His
grace, shew to them this glorious place where is ever day
and never night. And this place is called Paradise Terrestrial.
By this island is another island wherein no man
may come, and this young man said to them: "Ye have
been here half a year without meat, drink, or sleep," and
they supposed they had not been there the space of half
an hour, so merry and joyful they were there. And the
young man told them that this is the place that Adam and
Eve dwelt in first, and ever should have dwelled here if
that they had not broken the commandment of God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>Then the young man brought them to their ship again
and said they might no longer abide there; and when they
were all shipped, suddenly this young man vanished away
out of their sight. And then within short time after, by
the purveyance of our Lord Jesu Christ, they came to the
abbey where Saint Brandon dwelled, and then he with
his brethren received them goodly and demanded them
where they had been so long, and they said: "We have
been in the Land of Behest, tofore the gates of paradise,
whereas is ever day and never night." And they said all
that the place is full delectable, for yet all their clothes
smelled of the sweet and joyful place.</p>

<p>And then Saint Brandon purposed soon after for to seek
that place by God's help, and anon began to purvey for a
good ship and a strong, and victualled it for seven years.
And then he took his leave of all his brethren and took
twelve monks with him, but, ere they entered into the
ship, they fasted forty days and lived devoutly, and each
of them received the sacrament. And when Saint Brandon
with his twelve monks were entered into the ship,
there came other two of his monks and prayed him that
they might sail with him, and then he said: "Ye may
sail with me, but one of you shall go to hell ere you come
again." But for all that they would go with him.</p>

<p>And then Saint Brandon bade the shipmen to wind up
the sail, and forth they sailed in God's name, so that on
the morrow they were out of sight of any land. And forty
days and forty nights after they sailed plat east, and then
they saw an island far from them; and they sailed thitherward
as fast as they could, and they saw a great rock of
stone appear above all the water; and three days they sailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>about it ere they could get into the place, but at the last,
by the purveyance of God, they found a little haven and
there went aland every each one. And then suddenly came
a fair hound, and fell down at the feet of Saint Brandon
and made him good cheer in his manner. And then he
bade his brethren be of good cheer, "For our Lord hath
sent to us his messenger to lead us into some good place."
And the hound brought them into a fair hall, where they
found the tables spread, ready set full of good meat and
drink. And then Saint Brandon said graces, and then he
and his brethren sat down and ate and drank of such as
they found, and there were beds ready for them wherein
they took their rest after their long labour.</p>

<p>And on the morn they returned again to their ship, and
sailed a long time in the sea after, ere they could find any
land, till at last, by the purveyance of God, they saw far
from them a full fair island, full of green pasture, wherein
were the whitest and greatest sheep that ever they saw;
for every sheep was as great as an ox. And soon after
came to them a goodly old man, which welcomed them
and made to them good cheer, and said: "This is the
Island of Sheep. And here is never cold weather but
ever summer, and that causeth the sheep to be so great
and white: they eat of the best grass and herbs that is
anywhere." And then this old man took his leave of
them and bade them sail forth right east, and within short
time, by God's grace, they should come into a place like
paradise wherein they should keep their Eastertide.</p>

<p>And then they sailed forth, and came soon after to that
land, but could find no haven because of little depth in
some place, and in some place were great rocks. But at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the last they went upon an island, weening to them that
they had been safe, and made thereon a fire for to dress
their dinner, but Saint Brandon abode still in the ship.
When the fire was right hot and the meat nigh sodden,
then this island began to move, whereof the monks were
afeard, and fled anon to the ship and left the fire and
meat behind them, and marvelled sore of the moving.
And Saint Brandon comforted them and said that it was a
great fish named Jasconye, which laboureth night and day
to put his tail in his mouth but for greatness he may not.</p>

<p>And then anon they sailed west three days and three
nights ere they saw any land, wherefore they were right
heavy, but soon after, as God would, they saw a fair island
full of flowers, herbs, and trees; whereof they thanked
God of His good grace, and anon they went on land. And
when they had gone long in this, they found a full fair
well, and thereby stood a fair tree full of boughs, and on
every bough sat a fair bird, and they sat so thick on the
tree that unnethe any leaf of the tree might be seen. The
number of them was so great and they sang so merrily
that it was an heavenly noise to hear, wherefore Saint
Brandon kneeled down on his knees and wept for joy,
and made his prayers devoutly to our Lord God to know
what these birds meant. And then anon one of these
birds fled from the tree to Saint Brandon, and he with
flickering of his wings made a full merry noise like a fiddle,
that him seemed he heard never so joyful a melody. And
then Saint Brandon commanded the bird to tell him the
cause why they sat so thick on the tree and sang so merrily.
And then the bird said: "Sometime we were angels in
heaven. But when our master Lucifer fell down into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>hell for his high pride, we fell with him for our offences,
some higher and some lower, after the quality of the trespass,
and because our trespass is but little, therefore our
Lord hath set us here, out of all pain, in full great joy and
mirth, after His pleasing, here to serve Him in this tree
in the best manner we can. The Sunday is a day of rest
from all worldly occupation, and therefore this day all we
be made as white as any snow for to praise our Lord in
the best wise we may." And then this bird said to Saint
Brandon: "It is twelve months passed that ye departed
from your abbey, and in the seventh year hereafter ye
shall see the place that ye desire to come to. And all
these seven years, ye shall keep your Easter here with us
every year, and in the end of the seventh year ye shall
come unto the Land of Behest."</p>

<p>And this was on Easter Day that the bird said these
words to Saint Brandon; and then this fowl flew again to
his fellows that sat on the tree, and then the birds began
to sing evensong so merrily that it was an heavenly noise
to hear. And after supper Saint Brandon and his fellows
went to bed and slept well; and on the morn they arose
betimes, and then those birds began matins, prime, and
hours, and all such service as Christian men use to sing.
And Saint Brandon with his fellows abode there eight
weeks, till Trinity Sunday was passed.</p>

<p>And they sailed again to the Island of Sheep, and they
victualled them well, and took their leave of that old man
and returned again to ship. And then the bird of the tree
came again to Saint Brandon and said: "I am come to tell
you that ye shall sail from hence into an island, wherein is
an abbey of twenty-four monks, which is from this place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>many a mile, and there ye shall hold your Christmas and
your Easter with us, like as I told you." And then this
bird flew to his fellows again.</p>

<p>Then Saint Brandon and his fellows sailed forth in
the ocean, and soon after fell a great tempest on them in
which they were greatly troubled long time and sore for-laboured.
And after that they found, by the purveyance of
God, an island that was far from them, and then they full
meekly prayed our Lord to send them thither in safety, but
it was forty days after ere they came thither; wherefore
all the monks were so weary of that trouble that they set
little price by their lives, and cried continually to our Lord
to have mercy on them, and bring them to that island in
safety. And, by the purveyance of God, they came at the
last into a little haven, but it was so strait that unnethe<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a>
the ship might come in; and after, they came to an anchor,
and anon the monks went to land. And when they had
long walked about, at the last they found two fair wells:
one was fair and clear water, but the other was somewhat
troubly and thick. And then they thanked our Lord fully
humbly that had brought them thither in safety; and they
would fain have drunken of that water, but Saint Brandon
charged them they should not take without licence: "For
if we abstain us awhile, our Lord will purvey for us in the
best wise." And anon after came to them a fair old man
with hoar hair, and welcomed them full meekly and kissed
Saint Brandon, and led them by many a fair well till they
came to a fair abbey, where they were received with great
honour and solemn procession with twenty-four monks all
in royal copes of cloth of gold, and a royal cross was before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>them. And then the abbot welcomed Saint Brandon and
his fellowship, and kissed them full meekly, and took
Saint Brandon by the hand and led him with his monks
into a fair hall, and set them down arow upon the bench,
and the abbot of the place washed all their feet with fair
water of the well that they saw before, and after, he led them
into a fraitour<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> and there set them among his convent.
And anon there came one, by the purveyance of God, which
served them well of meat and drink, for every monk had
set before him a fair white loaf and white roots and herbs
which were right delicious, but they wist not what roots
they were. And they drank of the water of the fair clear
well which they saw before when they came first aland,
which Saint Brandon forbade them.</p>

<p>And then the abbot came and cheered Saint Brandon
and his monks and bade them eat and drink for charity:
"For every day our Lord sendeth a goodly old man that
covereth this table and setteth our meat and drink tofore
us, but we know not how it cometh, ne we ordain never
no meat ne drink for us, and yet we have been eighty
years here, and ever our Lord, worshipped may He be,
feedeth us. We be twenty-four monks in number, and
every ferial<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> day of the week He sendeth to us twelve
loaves, and every Sunday and feast day twenty-four loaves,
and the bread that we leave at dinner we eat at supper.
And now at your coming our Lord hath sent unto us
forty-eight loaves, for to make you and us merry together
as brethren. And always twelve of us go to dinner while
other twelve keep the quire, and thus have we done these
eighty years, for so long have we dwelled in this abbey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>We came hither out of the abbey of Saint Patrick in
Ireland, and thus as ye see our Lord hath purveyed for
us, but none of us knoweth how it cometh but God alone
to whom be given honour and laud, world without end.
Here in this land is ever fair weather, and none of us
hath ever been sick sith we came hither. And when we
go to mass or to any other service of our Lord in the
church, anon seven tapers of wax be set in the quire
and be lighted at every time without man's hand, and so
burn day and night at every hour of service, and never
waste ne minish as long as we have been here, which is
eighty years."</p>

<p>Then Saint Brandon went to the church with the abbot
of the place, and there they said evensong together full
devoutly, and then Saint Brandon looked upward towards
the crucifix and saw our Lord hanging on the cross,
which was made of fine crystal and curiously wrought.
And in the quire were twenty-four seats for twenty-four
monks, and the seven tapers burning, and the abbot's
seat was made in the midst of the quire. Then Saint
Brandon demanded of the abbot how long they had kept
that silence, that none of them spake to other, and he
said: "This twenty-four years we spake never one to
another." And then Saint Brandon wept for joy of their
holy conversation. And then Saint Brandon desired of
the abbot that he and his monks might dwell there still
with him. To whom the abbot said: "Sir, that may ye
not do in no wise, for our Lord hath shewed to you in
what manner ye shall be guided till the seven years be
fulfilled, and after that term thou shalt with thy monks
return into Ireland in safety, but one of the two monks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>that came last to you shall dwell in the Island of Ankers,<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a>
and that other shall go quick to hell."</p>

<p>And as Saint Brandon kneeled in the church, he saw a
bright shining angel come in at the window, and lighted
all the lights in the church, and then he flew out again at
the window unto heaven. Then Saint Brandon marvelled
greatly how the light burned so fair and wasted not. Then
the abbot said, "It is written that Moses saw a bush all
on afire and yet it burned not, and therefore marvel not
hereof, for the might of our Lord is now as great as it
ever was."</p>

<p>And when Saint Brandon had dwelled there from
Christmas even till the twelfth day was passed, then he
took his leave of the abbot of the convent and returned
with his monks to his ship. And he sailed from thence with
his monks toward the abbey of Saint Illaries; but they had
great tempests in the sea from that time till Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>And then they came to the Island of Sheep and there
were received of the old man, which brought them to a
fair hall and served them. And on Shere Thursday<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> after
supper he did wash all their feet and kissed them, like as
our Lord did to His disciples, and there they abode till
Saturday, Easter Even; and they departed and sailed to the
place where the fish lay; and anon they saw their cauldron
upon the fish's back, which they had left there twelve
months tofore. There they kept the service of the resurrection,
on the fish's back, and after, they sailed that same
day by the morning to the island whereas the tree of
birds was, and then the said bird welcomed Saint Brandon
and all his fellowship, and went again to the tree and sang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>full merrily. And there he and his monks dwelled from
Easter till Trinity Sunday, as they did the year before, in
full great joy and mirth. And daily they heard the merry
service of the birds sitting on the tree.</p>

<p>And then the bird told to Saint Brandon that he should
return again at Christmas to the abbey of monks, and at
Easter thither again, and the other deal of the year labour
in the ocean in full great perils, and from year to year
till the seven years be accomplished. "And then shall ye
come to the joyful place of paradise and dwell there forty
days in full great joy and mirth. And after, ye shall return
home into your own abbey in safety, and there end your
life and come to the bliss of heaven to which our Lord
bought you with His precious blood."</p>

<p>And then the angel of our Lord ordained all thing that
was needful to Saint Brandon and to his monks in victuals
and all other things necessary, and then they thanked our
Lord of His great goodness He had shewed to them oft in
their great need, and sailed forth in the great sea ocean,
abiding the mercy of our Lord in great trouble and tempests.</p>

<p>And soon after came to them an horrible fish which
followed the ship long time, casting so much water out of
his mouth into the ship that they supposed to have been
drowned, wherefore they devoutly prayed God to deliver
them of that great peril. And anon after, came another
fish, greater than he, out of the west sea, and fought with
him, and at the last clave him into three pieces, and then
returned again. And then they thanked meekly our Lord
for their deliverance from this great peril, but they were
in great heaviness because their victuals were nigh spent.
But, by the ordinance of our Lord, there came a bird and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>brought to them a great branch of a vine full of red
grapes, by which they lived fourteen days, and then they
came to a little island, wherein were many vines full of
grapes. And they there landed and thanked God, and
gathered as many grapes as they lived by forty days after,
alway sailing in the sea in many storms and tempests.</p>

<p>And as they thus sailed, suddenly came flying towards
them a great grip<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> which assailed them and was like to
have destroyed them. Wherefore they devoutly prayed
for help and aid of our Lord Jesu Christ. And then the
bird of the tree of the island where they had holden their
Easter tofore came to the grip and smote out both his
eyes and after slew him, whereof they thanked our Lord.</p>

<p>And then they sailed forth continually till Saint Peter's
day, and then sang they solemnly their service in the
honour of the feast. And in that place the water was so
clear that they might see all the fishes that were about
them, whereof they were full sore aghast, and the monks
counselled Saint Brandon to sing no more, for all the
fishes lay then as they had slept. And then Saint Brandon
said: "Dread ye not, for ye have kept by two Easters
the feast of the resurrection upon the great fish's back,
and therefore dread ye not of these little fishes." And
then Saint Brandon made him ready and went to mass
and bade his monks to sing the best way they could, and
then anon all the fishes awoke and came about the ship
so thick that unnethe they might see the water for the
fishes, and when the mass was done, all the fishes departed
so as they were no more seen. And seven days
they sailed always in that clear water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>And then there came a south wind and drove the ship
northward, whereas they saw an island full dark and full
of stench and smoke, and there they heard great blowing
and blasting of bellows, but they might see nothing, but
heard great thundering, whereof they were sore afraid and
blessed them oft. And soon after, there came one starting
out all burning in fire and gazed full ghastly on them
with great staring eyes, of whom the monks were aghast,
and at his departing from them he made the horriblest cry
that might be heard. And soon there came a great number
of fiends and assailed them with hooks and burning
iron malles, which ran on the water, following their ship
fast, in such wise that it seemed all the sea to be on fire.
But by the pleasure of our Lord, they had no power to
hurt nor grieve them nor their ship: wherefore the fiends
began to roar and cry and threw their hooks and malles
at them. And they then were sore afeard and prayed to
God for comfort and help, for they saw the fiends all
about the ship, and them seemed then all the island and
the sea to be on fire. And with a sorrowful cry all the
fiends departed from them and returned to the place that
they came from. And then Saint Brandon told to them
that this was a part of hell, and therefore he charged them
to be steadfast in the faith, for they should yet see many a
dreadful place ere they came home again.</p>

<p>And then came the south wind and drove them further
to the north, where they saw an hill all of fire, and a foul
smoke and stench coming from thence, and the fire stood
on each side of the hill, like a wall, all burning. And then
one of his monks began to cry and weep full sore, and
said that his end was come and that he might abide no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>longer in the ship; and anon he leapt out of the ship into
the sea, and then he cried and roared full piteously, cursing
the time that he was born and also father and mother
that begat him, because they saw no better to his correction
in his young age, "for now I must go to perpetual
pain." And then the saying of the blessed Saint Brandon
was verified that he said to him when he entered. Therefore
it is good a man to do penance and forsake sin, for
the hour of death is uncertain.</p>

<p>And then anon the wind turned into the north and
drove the ship into the south, which sailed seven days
continually, and they came to a great rock standing in the
sea, and thereon sat a naked man in full great misery and
pain, for the waves of the sea had so beaten his body that
all the flesh was gone off, and nothing left but sinews and
bare bones. And when the waves were gone, there was a
canvas that hung over his head which beat his body full
sore with the blowing of the wind; and also there were
two ox-tongues and a great stone that he sat on which did
him full great ease.</p>

<p>And then Saint Brandon charged him to tell him what
he was. And he said: "My name is Judas, that sold our
Lord Jesu Christ for thirty pence, which sitteth here thus
wretchedly, howbeit I am worthy to be in the greatest
pain that is. But our Lord is so merciful that He hath
rewarded me better than I have deserved, for of right my
place is in the burning hell, but I am here but certain
times of the year, that is, from Christmas to Twelfth Day,
and from Easter till Whitsuntide be past, and every feastful
day of our Lady, and every Saturday noon till Sunday
that evensong be done. But all other times, I lie still in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>hell, in full burning fire, with Pilate, Herod, and Caiaphas;
therefore accursed be the time that ever I knew them."</p>

<p>And then Judas prayed Saint Brandon to abide still
there all that night, and that he would keep him there
still, that the fiends should not fetch him to hell. And
Saint Brandon said, "With God's help thou shalt abide
here all this night." And then he asked Judas what cloth
that was that hung over his head, and he said that it was
a cloth that he gave to a leper, which was bought with the
money that he stole from our Lord when he bare His
purse. "Wherefore, it doth to me full great pain now in
beating my face with the blowing of the wind, and these
two ox-tongues that hang here above me, I gave them
sometime to two priests to pray for me; them I bought
with mine own money, and therefore they ease me, because
the fishes of the sea gnaw on them and spare me.
And this stone that I sit on lay sometime in a desolate
place where it eased no man, and I took it thence, and
laid it in a foul way, where it did much ease to them that
went by that way, and therefore it easeth me now, for
every good deed shall be rewarded and every evil deed
shall be punished."</p>

<p>And the Sunday, against even, there came a great multitude
of fiends, blasting and roaring, and they bade Saint
Brandon go thence that they might have their servant
Judas, "For we dare not come in the presence of our master
but if we bring him to hell with us." And then said
Saint Brandon: "I let not you to do your master's commandment,
but by the power of the Lord Jesu Christ, I
charge you to leave him this night till tomorrow." They
said: "How darest thou help him that so sold his master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>for thirty pence to the Jews, and caused Him also to die
the most shameful death upon the cross?" And then
Saint Brandon charged the fiends by His passion that
they should not noy him that night. And then the fiends
went their way, roaring and crying, towards hell to their
master the great devil. And then Judas thanked Saint
Brandon so ruthfully that it was a pity to see. And on
the morrow the fiends came with a horrible noise, saying
that they had that night suffered great pain because they
brought not Judas, and said that he should suffer double
pain the six days following; and they took then Judas,
trembling for fear, with them to pain.</p>

<p>And after, Saint Brandon sailed southward three days
and three nights, and on the Friday they saw an island,
and then Saint Brandon began to sigh, and said: "I see
the island wherein Saint Paul the hermit dwelleth and
hath dwelled there forty years without meat and drink
ordained by man's hand." And when they came to the
land, Saint Paul came and welcomed them humbly. He
was old and foregrown<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> so that no man might see his
body. Of whom Saint Brandon said, weeping: "I see a
man that liveth more like an angel than a man, wherefore
we monks may be ashamed that we live not better."
Then Saint Paul said to Saint Brandon: "Thou art better
than I, for our Lord hath shewed to thee more privities
than he hath done to me; wherefore, thou oughtest to
be more praised than I."</p>

<p>To whom Saint Paul said: "Some time I was a monk
of Saint Patrick's abbey in Ireland and was warden of the
place whereas men enter into Saint Patrick's Purgatory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>and on a day there came one to me and I asked him
what he was, and he said: 'I am your abbot, Patrick, and
charge thee that thou depart from hence tomorn early to
the sea-side, and there thou shalt find a ship into which
thou must enter, which God has ordained for thee, whose
will thou must accomplish.' And so the next day I arose
and went forth, and found the ship, in which I entered,
and, by the purveyance of God, was I brought into this
island the seventh day after. And then I left the ship and
went to land, and there I walked up and down a good
while, and then, by the purveyance of God, there came an
otter, going upon his hinder feet, and brought me a flint
stone and an iron to smite fire with, in the two foreclaws
of his feet, and also, he had about his neck great plenty
of fish, which he cast down before me and went his way.
And I smote fire, and made a fire of sticks, and did seethe
the fish, by which I lived three days. And then the otter
came again and brought me fish for other three days, and
thus he hath done this fifty-one years, through the grace
of God. And there was a great stone out of which our
blessed Lord made to spring fair water clear and sweet,
whereof I drink daily. And thus have I lived one and
fifty years. I was forty years old when I came hither,
and am now an hundred and eleven years old, and abide
till it please our Lord Jesu Christ to send for me; and
if it pleased Him, I would fain be discharged of this
wretched life."</p>

<p>And then he bade Saint Brandon to take of the water
of the well and to carry it into his ship, "for it is time
that thou depart, for thou hast a great journey to do, for
thou shalt sail to an island which is forty days' sailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>hence, where thou shalt hold thine Easter like as thou
hast done tofore, whereas the tree of birds is. And from
thence thou shalt sail into the Land of Behest, and shalt
abide there forty days, and after return home into thy
country in safety."</p>

<p>And then these holy men took leave each of other, and
they wept both full sore, and kissed each other. Then Saint
Brandon entered into the ship, and sailed forty days even
south, in full great tempest, and on Easter Even they came
to their procurator, which made to them good cheer, as he
had beforetime. And from thence they came to the great
fish whereon they said matins and mass on Easter Day,
and when the mass was done, the fish began to move and
swam forth fast into the sea, whereof the monks were sore
aghast which stood upon him, for it was a great marvel to
see such a fish, so great as all a country, for to swim so
fast in the water, but, by the will of our Lord, this fish
set all the monks aland in the Paradise of Birds, all whole
and sound, and then returned to the place he came from.
And then Saint Brandon and his monks thanked our Lord
of their deliverance of the great fish, and kept their Eastertide
till Trinity Sunday, like as they had done beforetime.</p>

<p>And after this they took their ship and sailed east forty
days, and at the forty days' end it began to hail right fast,
and therewith came a dark mist which lasted long after,
which feared Saint Brandon and his monks, and they
prayed to our Lord to keep and help them. And then
anon came their procurator and bade them to be of good
cheer, for they were come into the Land of Behest.</p>

<p>And soon after, that mist passed away, and anon they
saw the fairest country eastward that any man might see,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>and it was so clear and bright that it was a heavenly sight
to behold, and all the trees were charged with ripe fruit,
and herb full of flowers. In which land they walked forty
days, but they could not see none end of that land, and
there was always day and never night, and the land temperate,
ne too hot ne too cold.</p>

<p>And at the last they came to a fair river, but they durst
not go over, and there came to them a fair young man,
and welcomed them courteously and called each by name,
and did great reverence to Saint Brandon. And he said
to them: "Be ye now joyful, for this is the land that
ye have sought, but our Lord will that ye depart hence
hastily, and He will show you more of His secrets, when
ye come again into the sea, and our Lord will that ye
lade your ship with the fruit of this land, and hie you
hence, for ye may no longer abide here, but thou shalt
sail again to thine own country, and soon after thou comest
home thou shalt die. And this water that thou seest
here departeth the world asunder, for on that other side of
this water may no man come that is in this life. And the
fruit that ye see here is always thus ripe every time of the
year; and always it is here light as ye now see. And he
that keepeth our Lord's hests at all times shall see this
land or he pass out of this world."</p>

<p>And then Saint Brandon and his monks took of that
fruit as much as they would, and also took with them
great plenty of precious stones, and then took their leave,
and went to ship weeping sore because they might no
longer abide there. And then they took their ship and
came home into Ireland in safety, whom their brethren
received with great joy, giving thankings to our Lord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>which had kept them all these seven years from many a
peril and brought them home in safety, to whom be given
honour and glory, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>And soon after, this holy man, Saint Brandon, waxed
feeble and sick and had but little joy of this world, but
ever after his joy and mind was in the joys of heaven.
And in a short time after, he, being full of virtues, departed
out of this life to everlasting life, and was worshipfully
buried in a fair abbey, which he himself founded,
where our Lord shewed for this holy saint many fair
miracles. Wherefore let us devoutly pray to this holy
saint that he pray for us to our Lord that He have mercy
on us; to whom be given laud and honour and empire,
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3 title="THE LIFE OF SAINT MARGARET">THE LIFE OF SAINT MARGARET<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a></h3>

<p><i>Here followeth the glorious life and passion of the blessed virgin
and martyr Saint Margaret, and first of her name</i></p>


<p>Margaret is said of a precious gem, or ouche, that is
named a margaret. Which gem is white, little, and virtuous.
So the blessed Margaret was white by virginity,
little by humility, and virtuous by operation of miracles.
The virtue of this stone is said to be against effusion of
blood, against passion of the heart, and to confortation of
the spirit. In like wise the blessed Margaret had virtue
against shedding of her blood by constancy, for in her
martyrdom she was most constant, and also against the
passion of the heart, that is to say, temptation of the devil.
For she overcame the devil by victory, and to the confortation
of the spirit by doctrine, for by her doctrine she comforted
much people, and converted to the faith of Christ.
Theoteinus, a learned man, wrote her legend.</p>

<p>The holy Saint Margaret was of the city of Antioch,
daughter of Theodosius, patriarch and prince of the idols
of paynims. And she was delivered to a nurse for to be
kept. And when she came to perfect age she was baptized,
wherefore she was in great hate of her father.</p>

<p>On a certain day, when she was fifteen years of age
and kept the sheep of her nurse with other maidens, the
provost Olybrius passed by the way whereas she was, and
considered in her so great beauty and fairness, that anon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>he burned in her love, and sent his servants and bade
them take her and bring her to him. "For if she be free,
I shall take her to my wife, and if she be bond, I shall
make her my concubine." And when she was presented
tofore him he demanded her of her lineage, name, and
religion. And she answered that she was of noble lineage,
and for her name Margaret, and Christian in religion. To
whom the provost said: "The two first things be convenient
to thee, that is that thou art noble and art called Margaret,
which is a most fair name, but the third appertaineth nothing
to thee, that so fair a maid and so noble should have
a God crucified." To whom she said: "How knowest thou
that Christ was crucified?" He answered: "By the books
of Christian men." To whom Margaret said: "O what shame
is it to you, when you read the pain of Christ and the
glory, and believe one thing and deny another." And she
said and affirmed Him to be crucified by His will for our
redemption, and now liveth ever in bliss. And then the
provost, being wroth, commanded her to be put in prison.
And the next day following he commanded that she should
be brought to him, and then said to her: "O good maid,
have pity on thy beauty, and worship our gods, that thou
mayest be well." To whom she said: "I worship Him that
maketh the earth to tremble, whom the sea dreadeth and
the winds and creatures obey." To whom the provost said:
"But if thou consent to me I shall make thy body to be all
to-torn." To whom Margaret said: "Christ gave Himself
over to the death for me, and I desire gladly to die for
Christ." Then the provost commanded her to be hanged
in an instrument to torment the people, and to be cruelly
first beaten with rods, and with iron combs to rend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>draw her flesh to the bones, insomuch that the blood ran
about out of her body, like as a stream runneth out of a
fresh springing well. They that were there wept, and
said: "O Margaret, verily we be sorry for thee, which see
thy body so foul, and so cruelly torn and rent. O how thy
most beauty hast thou lost for thy incredulity and misbelief!
Now believe, and thou shalt live." Then said she to them:
"O evil counsellors, depart ye, and go from me; this cruel
torment of my flesh is salvation of my soul." Then she
said to the provost: "Thou shameless hound and insatiable
lion, thou hast power over my flesh, but Christ reserveth
my soul." The provost covered his face with his mantle,
for he might not see so much effusion of blood, and then
commanded that she should be taken down, and to shut
her fast in prison, and there was seen a marvellous brightness
in the prison, of the keepers.</p>

<p>And whilst she was in prison, she prayed our Lord that
the fiend that had fought with her, He would visibly show
him unto her. And then appeared a horrible dragon and
assailed her, and would have devoured her, but she made
the sign of the cross, and anon he vanished away. And
in another place it is said that he swallowed her into his
belly, she making the sign of the cross. And the belly
brake asunder, and so she issued out all whole and sound.</p>

<p>This swallowing and breaking of the belly of the dragon
is said that it is apocryphal.</p>

<p>After this the devil appeared to her in likeness of a
man for to deceive her. And when she saw him, she went
to prayer and after arose, and the fiend came to her, and
took her by the hand and said: "It sufficeth to thee that
thou hast done, but now cease as to my person." She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>caught him by the head and threw him to the ground
and set her right foot on his neck, saying: "Lie still, thou
fiend, under the feet of a woman." The devil then cried:
"O blessed Margaret, I am overcome. If a young man had
overcome me I had not recked, but alas! I am overcome
of a tender virgin; wherefore I make the more sorrow,
for thy father and mother have been my good friends."
She then constrained him to tell why he came to her, and
he answered that he came to her to counsel her for to
obey the desire and request of the provost. Then she constrained
him to say wherefore he tempted so much and
so often Christian people. To whom he answered that
naturally he hated virtuous men, and though we be oft
put aback from them, yet our desire is much to exclude
them from the felicity that they fell from, for we may
never obtain ne recover our bliss that we have lost. And
she then demanded what he was, and he answered: "I
am Veltis, one of them whom Solomon closed in a vessel
of brass. And after his death it happed that they of Babylon
found this vessel, and supposed to have founden great
treasure therein, and brake the vessel; and then a great
multitude of us devils flew out and filled full the air alway,
awaiting and espying where we may assail rightful men."
And when he had said thus, she took off her foot and said
to him: "Flee hence, thou wretched fiend." And anon the
earth opened, and the fiend sank in. Then she was sure,
for when she had overcome the master, she might lightly
overcome the minister.</p>

<p>Then the next day following, when all the people was
assembled, she was presented tofore the judge. And she,
not doing sacrifice to their false gods, was cast into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>fire, and her body broiled with burning brands, in such
wise that the people marvelled that so tender a maid might
suffer so many torments. And after that, they put her in
a great vessel full of water, fast bounden, that by changing
of the torments, the sorrow and feeling of the pain should
be the more. But suddenly the earth trembled, and the
air was hideous, and the blessed virgin without any hurt
issued out of the water, saying to our Lord: "I beseech
thee, my Lord, that this water may be to me the font of
baptism to everlasting life." And anon there was heard
great thunder, and a dove descended from heaven and set
a golden crown on her head. Then five thousand men
believed in our Lord, and for Christ's love they all were
beheaded by the commandment of the provost Olybrius,
that time in Campolymeath, the city of Aurelia.</p>

<p>Then Olybrius, seeing the faith of the holy Margaret
immoveable, and also fearing that others should be converted
to the Christian faith by her, gave sentence and
commanded that she should be beheaded. Then she
prayed to one Malchus that should behead her, that she
might have space to pray. And that got, she prayed to
our Lord, saying: "Father Almighty, I yield to Thee
thankings that Thou hast suffered me to come to this
glory, beseeching Thee to pardon them that pursue me.
And I beseech Thee, good Lord, that of Thy abundant
grace, Thou wilt grant unto all them that write my passion,
read it, or hear, and to them that remember me, that they
may deserve to have plain remission and forgiveness of all
their sins. And also, good Lord, if any woman with child,
travailing in any place, call on me, that Thou wilt keep her
from peril, and that the child may be delivered from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>belly without any hurt of his members." And when she
had finished her prayer there was a voice heard from
heaven, saying that her prayers were heard and granted
and that the gates of heaven were open and abode for her,
and bade her come into the country of everlasting rest.
Then she, thanking our Lord, arose up, and bade the
hangman accomplish the commandment of the provost.
To whom the hangman said: "God forbid that I should
slay thee, virgin of Christ." To whom she said: "If thou
do it not thou mayest have no part with me." Then he,
being afraid and trembling, smote off her head, and he,
falling down at her feet, gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>Then Theoteinus took up the holy body, and bare it into
Antioch, and buried it in the house of a noble woman and
widow named Sincletia. And thus this blessed and holy
virgin, Saint Margaret, suffered death, and received the
crown of martyrdom the thirteenth kalends of August, as
is founden in her story; and it is read in another place
that it was the third ides of July. Of this virgin writeth
an holy man and saith: "The holy and blessed Margaret
was full of the dread of God, sad, stable, and worshipful
in religion, arrayed with compunction, laudable in honesty,
and singular in patience, and nothing was found in her
contrary to Christian religion; hateful to her father, and
beloved of our Lord Jesu Christ." Then let us remember
this holy virgin that she pray for us in our needs.</p>

<p>There was a man beyond the sea, a miner who lived in
a city and who sought under the earth for the stones out
of which men get silver and gold. He worked and dug in
the hill, and a dreadful thing happened to him: a large part
of the mine fell down, closing him in. His fellows, who
were loyal to him, believed that he was dead, so they took
counsel together and went to tell his wife. This woman
bewailed her husband sorely (would God there were many
such women!). She helped his soul in all ways by giving
alms and offerings. She offered for his sake at the altar a
pitcher full of wine and a fair loaf, also, every day during
a whole twelve months, except on one day. Few such women
we find now, who are so kind to their husbands, but this
wife with all her power wrought for him both day and night.</p>

<p>It happened at the end of the twelve months that his
fellows went to the hill and came to the very place where
they had left their companion at work. They began right
there and, piercing through, found the man in good
estate, alive, without any injury or wound. Each one was
filled with amazement, and there was good reason why
the men should be in doubt as to how he had lived all
that year. Then he told them how he had lived there
alone. "I have lived a gracious life through the courtesy
of my wife, who every day has sent me wine and bread,
except on one day, when I ate nothing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>They led the man in to the town and told the miracle
everywhere through the city and through the country. At
last it happened that he mentioned the name of the day
when he fasted, and his wife said the same thing,—the
day she made no offering was Good Friday. Now you may
hear how a devout deed of alms will feed a man, and so
you may understand that God is always pleased with good
offerings.</p>

<p>In spite of this tale, trust not your wives, nor your children,
but make your offerings yourselves. So kind a
woman as I have told about does not live now, you may
be sure. And no clerk who reads this will ever find one
of such good deeds. You men who are now present and
hear about the sacrament, know that the sacrament on the
altar has power over all things, as I have shown to the
ignorant but not to the learned, for the clerks know it well.
Let us pray our Creator that our Saviour, the Sacrament,
will save us body and soul, and grant that we may love Him
and be His forever.</p>

<p>Lord, Maker of all things, Almighty God in majesty,
that ever, without beginning, wert and art and shall be,
grant us both strength and opportunity so to serve Thy
pleasure that we may, through Thy grace, dwell with Thee
for ever and aye!</p>

<p>We ought to bear well in mind those miracles of our
Lady which are written in true story, showing how helpful
she ever is to mankind. Once upon a time it happened
in a city,—hearken well and ye may hear,—when Jews
were wont to be together among Christians, Christians
dwelt in one half of the city, and the Jews were forced to
live in one street. The Christian children had made for
themselves a pleasant place in a field, and there a Jew's
child often played with them. The child's father took no
heed of this and never cast an eye upon him, therefore
the child came and went whenever he chose to play. So
often did they play together that the Jew's son learned
their games and was just like one of the Christian children,
loved and welcomed by them.</p>

<p>At one Easter time, which the Christians kept with great
solemnity, a beautiful minster had been completed in the
midst of the city, and to it the Christian folk went to hear
both matins and mass, as, by Christian rule, is usual for
both the high and the low. Every one in best array, both
husbands and wives, attended. The children followed their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>fathers, as they were wont, and the Jew's child with right
good cheer was happy to go with them. When he was well
within the church, he thought he had never been so glad
as he was at that seemly sight, such as he had never seen
before—both lamps and tapers burning brightly, altars
wonderfully ornamented, and beautifully wrought gold
images of many good saints.</p>

<p>In a chair sat a comely Queen, all decorated with gold;
upon her arm she bore a blissful Babe, in kingly crown
as He should be. The child looked long at that Lady and
at that blissful Babe, and noted how people told their beads
before them, as Christian folk do. The Jew's child felt
such pleasure in all the sights he saw and thought them
all so sweet, that he was almost ravished with joy. When
high mass of the day was done, the priest bade all men
kneel down; the Jew's child took heed of this and knelt
among the Christians. Although he was pushed about by
the crowd, he was not afraid, and he spared no pains until
he too received the sacrament. Of such a child no one
took notice. When all things were brought to an end,
and every Christian drew towards home, the Jew, seeking
his child throughout the town, saw him come from the
church. He asked his son where he had been while he
had sought him all that day, and the boy told the whole
story of what he had done and seen. The father then
waxed mad with anger and said at once, "Thou gettest
thy reward"; and going to his hot oven that gleamed
as does a glowing coal, he cast the child into it, intending
to burn him to ashes. With the mouth-stone he
sealed the oven, and thought that the truth would not
be revealed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>When his mother heard this, in the very place where she
stood she fell into a frenzy and for woe became as if mad.
Always crying out, she went tearing her hair, in every
street in that city, now up, now down, everywhere, and
folk wondered about her and felt great pity. The mayor
and the bailiffs of the town, when they heard that cry,
halted her and made inquiry as to why she cried so wildly
and put people in such fear and sorrowed so, especially
on Easter Day. As soon as she could cease weeping, this
woful mother answered, "Sirs, ye have this city to keep;
as lords ye must needs execute law. Alas! alas! I am
destroyed, and must have help of you; I pray for a just
judgment; my cause I shall prove before you. My husband
has burned my child—shut him up in a glowing
oven! Go, see, sirs, and I will give you gold enough."</p>

<p>Both mayor and bailiffs, together with the people, went
to the Jew's oven, and as soon as they had arrived,
the mayor commanded, "Put down the stone." Then
every man might easily see how the oven roof, that was
round, was in appearance like glowing glass from roof to
ground. The child sat there whole and sound, not harmed
in hand nor hair, amidst the coals which were all about,
just as if he sat in a cool arbor. The child's mother, when
she saw that, thought she had never been so glad; into
the oven she started towards him, and soon had him out
with her. And all the people present there wondered
at that strange sight and praised God with good intent,
for a miracle is more than man's might. They asked him,
with one consent, how it was that he had had no harm
among the brands that burned so brightly, and the child
answered at once:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>"Never in all my life have I had such great happiness
as came to me after I was put into the oven. Both brands
and coals, in truth, that were beneath my feet, like fair
flowers, like special spices, seemed sweet to me. The blissful
Queen, that Maiden mild, who sits in church on her
throne, with that comely King, her Child, that blissful
Babe that she holds on her bosom, shielded me from
all harm, from coals and brands that burned so clearly,
from all the flames that flowed so wildly, and they could
never come near me."</p>

<p>Then men and women, all who were there, both small
and great, low and high, praised God heartily for this miracle.
The Jewess through her son's word was converted
to Christ, anon, and the child and all the Jews accepted
the law of Christ. The mayor himself examined the Jew
to judge of his trespass, and twelve men were sworn to
speak the truth and to give their verdict upon the case.
They took counsel together, and came back with one consent.
The words of their verdict were, "In that same oven
he shall be burned."</p>

<p>Thus is ended this story of the miracle written above.
Grant us joy in heaven on high, Lord Jesus, for Thy
Mother's love. Amen.</p>

<h3 title="THE TRANSLATION OF SAINT THOMAS OF CANTERBURY">THE TRANSLATION OF SAINT THOMAS OF
CANTERBURY<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a></h3>


<p>The translation of the glorious martyr, Saint Thomas
of Canterbury, we shall shortly rehearse unto the laud and
praising of Almighty God, then in the fiftieth year after
his passion, which was the year of jubilee, that is, of remission.
For, of ancient time, the fiftieth year was called
the year of the jubilee of pardon and remission, and is
yet used among religious men. For when a religious
man hath continued in his order fifty years, then he shall
be admitted to make his jubilee, and that made, he is pardoned
and hath remission of many observances that tofore
he was bounden unto. Then in this year of jubilee from
his passion, was the solemnity of his translation accomplished,
in the time of Honorius, the third pope of that
name. The which granted yearly remissions and indulgences
so great and large, that tofore in no time of mind
hath been seen any popes to have granted and given like.
Then let us call to mind that on a Tuesday his translation
was accomplished. On the Tuesday happed to him many
things. On a Tuesday he was born, on a Tuesday he was
exiled, on a Tuesday our Lord appeared to him at Pountney
in France, saying: "Thomas, my church shall be glorified
in thy blood." On a Tuesday he returned from his
exile, and on a Tuesday he suffered martyrdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Then how this holy translation was fulfilled now ye shall
hear. The reverend father in God, Stephen, Archbishop
of Canterbury, Richard, Bishop of Salisbury, Walter, the
prior of the same place, with the convent, with spiritual
songs and devout hymns, when it was night, went to the
sepulchre of this holy martyr, and all that night and day
of his translation they persevered in prayers and fastings.
And after midnight, four priests, elected and thereto
chosen, approaching to his body, took up the holy head
with great devotion and reverence, and unto them all
offered it for to kiss it. Then the archbishop and all the
others made great honour to it, and took all the relics of
the precious body, and laid them in a chest, and shut it
fast with iron locks, and set it in a place for to be kept
unto the day that the translation should be solemnized.
The day then of this holy translation being come, there
were present a great innumerable multitude of people, as
well of rich as of poor. There was Pandulphus, a legate
of our holy father the pope, and two archbishops of France,
of Rheims and Arles, with many other bishops and abbots,
and also King Harry the Third with earls and barons,
which king himself took the chest upon his shoulders,
and with the other prelates and lords, brought it with great
joy and honour in to the place where it is now worshipped,
and was laid in a fair and much rich shrine. At whose
holy translation were showed, by the merits of this holy
martyr, Saint Thomas, many miracles. To blind men was
given their sight, to deaf men their hearing, to dumb men
their speech, and to dead men was restored life.</p>

<p>Among all others there was a man, because of great
devotion that he had to be at this holy translation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>visit the holy martyr, which came to the bridge at Brentford
by London; and when he was in the middle of the
bridge, meeting there one, was cast into the water. This
man, not forgetting himself, called Saint Thomas unto his
help, and besought him not to suffer his pilgrim to perish,
ne to be there drowned. And five times he sank down
to the ground, and five times arose above the water, and
then he was cast to the dry ground. Then he affirmed
that he received no water into his mouth, nor into his ears
that did to him grievance nor hurt that he felt, save in his
falling he felt in his mouth a little salt water; and added
more thereto, saying that, when he sank, a bishop held
him up that he might not sink.</p>

<p>This holy translation was done and accomplished the
year of our Lord twelve hundred and twenty, in the nones
of July, at three o'clock, in the fiftieth year after his passion.
For this glorious saint our Lord hath showed many great
miracles, as well by his life, as after his death and martyrdom.
For a little tofore his death a young man died and
was raised again by miracle. And he said that he was led
to see the holy order of saints in heaven, and there he
saw a seat void, and he asked for whom it was, and it was
answered to him that it was kept for the great Bishop of
England, Saint Thomas of Canterbury. There was also a
simple priest that daily sang no other mass but of our
Lady, whereof he was put to Saint Thomas his ordinary,
whom accused, he opposed, and found him full simple of
conning, wherefore he suspended him, and inhibited him
his mass. Wherefore this priest was full sorry, and prayed
humbly to our blessed Lady that he might be restored
again to say his mass. And then our blessed Lady appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>to this priest, and bade him go to Saint Thomas, and bid
him "by the token that the lady whom thou servest hath
sewed his shirt of hair with red silk, which he shall find
there as he laid it, that he give thee leave to sing mass,
and assoil thee of his suspending and thine inhibiting,
and restore thee again to thy service." And when Saint
Thomas heard this he was greatly abashed, and went and
found like as the priest had said, and then assoiled him to
say mass as he did before, commanding him to keep this
thing secret as long as he lived.</p>

<p>There was a lady in England that desired greatly to
have grey eyes, for she had a conceit that she should be
the more beauteous in the sight of the people; and only
for that cause she made a vow to visit Saint Thomas upon
her bare feet. And when she came thither, and had devoutly
made her prayers to have her desire, suddenly she
wax stark blind, and then she perceived that she had
offended and displeased our Lord in that request, and
cried God mercy of that offence, and besought him full
meekly to be restored of her sight again. And by the
merits of the blessed Saint Thomas she was restored to
her sight again, and was glad to have her old eyes, and
returned home again, and lived holy to her life's end.
Also there was a lord's carver that brought water to him at
his table, to whom the lord said: "If thou hast ever stolen
anything of mine, I pray God and Saint Thomas that thou
have no water in the bason," and suddenly it was all void
of the water and dry, and there was he proved a thief.</p>

<p>There was a tame bird kept in a cage, which was learned
to speak. And on a time he fled out of the cage and flew
into the field; and there came a sparrowhawk and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>have taken this bird and pursued after. And the bird, being
in great dread, cried: "Saint Thomas! help!" like as he
had heard others speak, and the sparrowhawk fell down
dead, and the bird escaped harmless.</p>

<p>Also there was a man that Saint Thomas loved much
in his days, and he fell in a grievous sickness, wherefore
he went to the tomb of Saint Thomas to pray for his
health; and anon he had his desire and was all whole. And
as he turned homeward, being all whole, then he began to
dread lest this health should not be the most profitable for
his soul. Then he returned again to the tomb of Saint
Thomas, and prayed if his health were not profitable to his
soul that his old sickness might come again to him. And
it came anon again to him, and endured unto his life's end.
And in like wise there was a devout blind man which had
his sight restored to him again by the merit of Saint
Thomas; but after, he repented him, for he could not be
so quiet in his mind as he was before, he had then so much
letting by seeing the vanities of the world. Wherefore he
prayed to our Lord that by the merits of Saint Thomas
he might be blind again to the world as he was before,
and anon he had his desire, and lived after full holily to
his life's end. Who should tell all the miracles that our
blessed Lord hath showed for this holy martyr, it should
overmuch endure, for ever sith his passion unto this day,
God hath showed continually for him many great miracles.
Then let us pray this holy saint to be a special advocate
for us wretched sinners unto our Lord God, who bring
us unto His everlasting bliss in heaven.</p>

<h3 title="AN EXTRACT FROM &#34;THE CASTLE OF LOVE&#34;">AN EXTRACT FROM "THE CASTLE OF LOVE"<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a></h3>


<p>The King had a castle made, after His own device, so
that it would never dread the assault of any enemies. He
set it on a white rock, thick and high, with good ditches
all about, deep and wide. Men can never undermine this
castle by any kind of craft, nor can any engine do it harm.
The castle is ever full of love and grace for any one who
has need of succor. Four towers it has, with fair battlements,
and three courts. Heart cannot think nor can
tongue tell all the bounty and the beauty of this castle.
Seven barbicans are set so securely that no manner of
shooting from without can cause harm. The castle is
painted on the outside in three colors: a red burning
color is above, towards the fair towers; the color of the
middle portion is blue softer than indigo; and near the
ground is green that never changes hue.</p>

<p>These colors cast such light both far and near that when
men behold them it greatly comforts their sight. The
castle, within, is ever blanched as white as any driven snow.
Four fair streams flow out of a well in the middle of the
highest tower and fill the ditches. So fair and so good
is the water, that he who drinks of it has great bliss. A
throne of ivory there was set in this tower, and seven steps
lead upward, with great worship and honor. Never was a
throne half so fair seen in this world; nor did prince or
queen ever have so beautiful a one. It was made subtilely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>by wondrous design, and a rainbow steadfastly arched above
it. The King's Son made it for His own seat; never was
there one so fair, nor shall there ever be.</p>

<p>This castle of solace and of succor is the blessed body
of her who bore our Saviour, and is a refuge for all mankind.
Whosoever flees thither shall find succor. The
rock, white and fair and stable, is her heart in all its holiness,
that made her serve God without fear, in sovereign
purity of meekness and maidenhood. The green color, by
the ground, that will last so well, is the truth of our lady,
aye steadfast. The central color in the midst of this
castle wall is enduring hope to attain the grace that saves
mankind. The red color above, burning to the sight, is
the burning love of God and man, that gives great light.
No wonder if this castle is wholly white within, for the
heart of that maiden was never defiled with sin. The four
towers, great and strong, so fair to see, were ghostly
strength and soberness, righteousness and skill.<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> These
four virtues drive out all manner of wickedness, and keep
fast, within, all goodness.</p>

<p>The courts, one within another, in three stages, are
clean maidenhood, motherhood, and true wifehood. There
never was a woman except Saint Mary with all these
three, but whosoever would be saved from sin, must have
one of these. The seven barbicans we call the seven fair
virtues, that suffered no vice to be in our Lady. Great
meekness in her heart forever vanquished pride; envy
could not abide her great charity; her devout abstinence
destroyed all gluttony, and her clean maidenhood forbade
lechery; wicked covetousness might never dwell in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>heart, because wilful poverty guarded that castle; patience
was always watching, so that the sin of wrath could never
have resting place. There was in her heart so much spiritual
comfort that the sin of sloth could never dwell therein.
The fair well of the castle, that ever fills the ditches, is
grace in God's mother, ever dear to sinful man. Thou
who hast need of grace, go to the well-spring; whosoever
has her help will never go to hell. Make the ditches of
meekness and of good will, and the four streams of grace
shall soon fill thee: one stream evermore shall wash thee
clean of sin, another shall make thee steadfast against
temptation, the third shall bear thee to bliss that is for aye.
This well is evermore the spring of mercy and of pity.
The throne of ivory is the soul of our sweet Lady; the
seven steps leading thereto are the seven works of mercy;
the rainbow of three colors bending over it is the might
of the holy Trinity, covering her. No wonder if this
castle is fair to see, since God, the sun of righteousness,
would alight therein. He came through the closed gate
just as the bright sunbeam comes and goes through the
glass. All that man has need of is in this castle; he who
has its help has happiness enough.</p>

<h3 title="THE LION">THE LION<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a></h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nature</span></h4>


<p class="center"><abbr title="1">I</abbr></p>

<p>The lion stands upon a hill, and if he hears a man hunting,
or through his nostrils scents one approaching, he fills
all his own footsteps, as he goes down to the dale, by drawing
either dust or dew into them with his tail, so that the
hunter cannot find him, and thus he speeds to his den and
there shelters himself.</p>


<p class="center"><abbr title="2">II</abbr></p>

<p>Another nature he has. When he is born he lies still
and stirs not from sleep until the sun has shone thrice
about him, then his father rouses him by the cry he makes.</p>


<p class="center"><abbr title="3">III</abbr></p>

<p>The third habit the lion has is this: when he lies down
to sleep he never closes the lids of his eyes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Signification</span></h4>


<p class="center"><abbr title="1">I</abbr></p>

<p>Very high is that hill which is the kingdom of heaven;
our Lord is the Lion, who lives there above. Though He
chose to alight here on earth, the devil, even if he be a
crafty hunter, could never know how He came down nor
how He dwelt in that humble maiden, Mary by name, who
bore Him for the salvation of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><abbr title="2">II</abbr>, <abbr title="3">III</abbr></p>

<p>Though our Lord was dead, and buried, as was His
will, and lay still in a stone until the third day, His father
aided Him, so that He arose from the dead, to keep us
alive. He watches, according to His will, as a shepherd,
and we are the sheep; He will shield us if we hear His
word, and go nowhere astray.</p>

<h3>THE EAGLE</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nature</span></h4>

<p>I will make known to you the nature of the eagle, as I
read about it in a book; how he renews his youth and how
he emerges from old age when his limbs are unwieldy and
his beak all twisted, and his flight is weak and his eyes
dim; hear how he recreates himself. He seeks a well
which springs up ever, both by night and by day; over
that he flies, and up he soars until he passes through the
sixth and the seventh skies and reaches heaven, and hovers
as close as he can to the sun. The sun scorches his wings
and makes his eyes bright; his feathers fall out because
of the heat, and he falls down then into the water to the
bottom of the well, where he becomes whole and sound
and comes out all new, except that his beak is crooked.
Since his beak is twisted, though his limbs are strong, he
cannot procure food for himself. Then he goes to a stone
and strikes his beak on it and continues to strike it until
his beak loses all its crookedness, and at once with his
straight bill he seizes what food he likes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Signification</span></h4>

<p>Man is like unto the eagle,—if you will listen,—old in
his secret sins, ere he becomes a Christian. Before he had
considered his sins his eyes were murky. Thus he may
renew himself if he goes to church, and, there renouncing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Satan and every sinful deed, betakes himself to Jesus Christ,
who will be his reward. He believes in our Lord Christ,
and learns the teachings of the priest, and the mist departs
from his eyes while he lingers there. His hope is all fixed
upon God, and he learns of His love which, like the sun,
again restores his sight. Naked he falls in the font, and
comes out all new, except for one little thing. What is
that? His mouth is still untrue, his mouth is still unfamiliar
with pater noster and creed. If he goes north or if he
goes south he will soon discover his need; he will beg a
favor from God and thus will make his mouth perfect; so
may he gain his soul's food, through the grace of our Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>



<h3>THE WHALE</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nature</span></h4>

<p>The whale is the largest fish that is in the ocean. You
would say, if you should see it afloat, that it is an island,
that sits upon the sea sand. When this fish, so unwieldy,
is hungry he opens his jaws wide, and out of his throat
comes a sweet odor, the sweetest thing that is on earth.
When other fish perceive it they are glad to draw near;
they come and hover in his mouth, unaware of his deceit.
Then the whale shuts his jaws, sucking in all these fish.
It is only the small ones he thus deceives; the big ones
he cannot catch. This fish dwells at the bottom of the
ocean, and lives there, always hale and well, until it comes
to be the time when storms stir all the sea. Then summer
and winter contend, and the whale cannot stay there, because
the sea bottom is so turbid, so he rises and lies still,
while the weather is so bad. Sailors in the ships driven
about on the sea, dreading to die and anxious to live, look
around and see this fish, and, believing it is an island, are
very happy as they draw near; with all their strength they
cast anchor, and go upon the island. By flint and steel
they start a fire burning well on this wonder, and warm
themselves, and eat and drink. The whale, feeling the
fire, sinks them, for he quickly dives down to the bottom
of the sea and thus drowns them all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Signification</span></h4>

<p>This devil is strong in wile and might, as witches are
in their craft; he makes men hunger and thirst and have
sinful desires; he entices men to him with his breath;
whoever follows him finds shame. It is the ones of little
faith whom he deceives, not those who are strong and
steadfast in flesh and spirit, holding to the true faith.
He who listens to the devil's teachings will at last repent
it sorely; he who fastens his hope on him will follow him
to dim hell.</p>

<h3>THE SIREN</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nature</span></h4>

<p>In the sea are many wonders. The mermaid is like a
maiden to the waist, but otherwise she is exactly like a fish
with fins. This marvel dwells in dangerous places where
the water is shallow, and she sinks ships and works harm
thus. Merrily this maid sings, and she has many voices,—many
and shrill,—but they are all evil, for sailors forget
their steering because of her singing, and they slumber
and sleep and wake too late; and the ships sink with the
confusion, and come up nevermore. Wise men and wary
know how to flee, and often escape with uncorrupted heart.
By this maiden of whom you have heard, this monster
half human and half fish, something is betokened.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Signification</span></h4>

<p>Many men illustrate the meaning of this example: without,
they wear the skin of sheep; within, they are wolves
wholly; they speak piously, but wicked are their deeds;
their deeds are all unlike what their mouths speak. Twofold
they are in spirit,—they swear by the cross, by the
sun, and by the moon, and they lie both in their speech
and in their singing. They deceive thee then; they destroy
thy goods with treachery and thy soul with lying.</p>

<p>Evax, king of Arabia, sent to Nero, the emperor of
Rome, a book which he had written concerning the nature
of stones, telling their kinds, their names, their colors, in
what lands they are found, and the virtues that they have.
Many of their virtues are hidden, but others are well known.
Doctors who know the powers of gems find them of great
aid in their medicines. No wise man can doubt that God
has placed great virtue in stones, as He has in herbs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Diamond</span></h3>

<p>The diamond is as clear as crystal, but it has also the
aspect of steel. It is found in India. Such great hardness
it has that neither with iron nor with fire can it be cut,
but if it is soaked in the hot blood of a goat, a man can
work it on the anvil with a hammer. The sharp splinters
which are broken off are used to cut other gems. This
stone is no bigger than a hazel-nut. In Arabia there is a
kind of diamond, not so hard, which can be cut without
goat's blood. It is not so beautiful nor so valuable as the
other, although it is larger. A third species comes from
Cypress, and a fourth from Greece. Each one has the
power of attracting iron. Enchanters use this stone in
their enchantments. It gives to the man who carries it
strength and virtue; it protects him from bad dreams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>from phantoms, from all poisons, and from all hates and
discord; it cures madmen, and defends a man against his
enemies. It should be set in gold or in silver, and worn
upon the left arm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sapphire</span></h3>

<p>Sapphire is fit for the fingers of kings; it is resplendent
and like the sky when free from clouds; there is no
other stone which has greater virtue or beauty. Men call
it Syrtites because it is found in the sand of Libya near
the Syrtes. The best is that which is found in Turkey,
for this is not translucent. It is of such great virtue that
it is by right called the gem of all gems. It comforts the
body and keeps its members whole; it overcomes envy
and treachery, and it drives away fear. It frees a man from
prison and looses heavy fetters; it is good for effecting
reconciliation, and is better than any other stone for seeing
in the water the signs which reveal things hitherto
not known. As medicine it is valuable because it cools an
internal fever; if a person dissolves it in milk it will cure
bad diseases. It is good for the eyes, and for headache, and
for disease of the tongue. He who carries it must be chaste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Amethyst</span></h3>

<p>The amethyst has a purple color, or sometimes is like
violet or like drops of wine or like a rose. Some there
are which turn almost white, others are like red wine
mixed with water. From India it comes; it is easy to
work, and it prevents intoxication. It would be precious
if it were not so abundant, but it is commonplace since
there is so much of it. There are five kinds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geratite</span></p>

<p>Geratite is black. It is of such a nature that if a man
opens his mouth and puts the stone under his tongue he
will divine what another person thinks of him, and can
win any woman's devotion. This stone can be tried as
follows: let a man anoint himself with milk and honey,
go out into the sunshine where insects swarm, and if he
has the stone in his mouth the insects will not attack
him; if he removes the stone they will at once sting him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chelidonius</span></h3>

<p>Chelidonius is a stone which one finds in the stomach
of a swallow. It is not very beautiful, but it surpasses all
the beautiful stones in usefulness. It is of ten sorts and
of two colors—black and red. The red is good for the
frenzy which seizes people who are moon-struck; it restores
their sanity to madmen and cures those who are
pining away. He who carries this stone will be a good
orator and will be much beloved. One must carry it
wrapped in linen cloth and suspended under the left arm.
The black, if worn in the same way, aids a man to accomplish
important things he has undertaken; it is also a
help against the threats and rages of kings and princes.
The water in which it is washed is helpful to diseased
eyes. If wrapped in linen cloth of saffron tint, it drives
away fever and restrains the humors which injure the body.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coral</span></h3>

<p>Coral is a stone which grows in the sea like a tree. It
is green there where it grows, but when it is exposed to
the air it hardens and becomes red. It is like a bush
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>hardly half a foot high. It is very good to carry about, as
say the authors Zoroaster and Metrodorus, for it protects
one from lightning and tempest, and if one scatters it on
vines or among olive trees, or upon a seeded field, it will
be a protection from hail and other storms. It makes
fruits multiply, it drives away phantoms, it gives a good
beginning and a prosperous conclusion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Heliotrope</span></h3>

<p>Heliotrope is of such a nature that if one puts it in a
basin of water opposite the sun, it makes the sun become
red and creates an eclipse. In a little while it makes the
water boil up over the basin's edge, and fall like a shower
of rain. He who wears this can prophesy many things.
It gives a man praise and good health, it stanches the
flow of blood, it overcomes poison and treachery. Any
one who takes the herb called heliotrope and binds the
two together with the proper incantation can walk where
he pleases and no one will see him. This stone comes
from Ethiopia, from Cypress, and from Africa. It is very
much like the emerald, but has red spots.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pearl</span></h3>

<p>The pearl is found in a shell, and it is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unio</i>
(union), because it is always found alone. The wise say
that the oyster shells are open at certain times, and they
receive the dew of heaven; the morning dews become
white and clear pearls, while the evening dews are obscure.
The young shells produce clearer pearls than the old ones
do. The more dew the shells receive, the larger is the
pearl, but no one is ever more than half an ounce in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>weight. If there is thunder when the dew is received,
then the pearls perish. They grow in India and in Great
Britain.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pantheros</span></h3>

<p>Pantheros is of various colors,—black, red, green, gray,
purple, and rose color. All these shades appear in combination.
Whoever sees it in the morning will not be defeated
in battle, that day, nor in any other undertaking. In India
there is a beast, of divers colors, called the panther, of whom
other beasts are afraid, and this stone is named after him.</p>


<h3 title="Symbolism of the Carbuncle"><span class="smcap">Symbolism of the Carbuncle</span><a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a></h3>

<p>The carbuncle is red, and surpasses the wonders of all
other stones. The books tell us that the gentle carbuncle,
fine and clear, is the lord of all stones, the gem of all
gems, and has the virtue of precious stones, above all. It
is of such superiority, that when he who wears it comes
among people, all accord him honor and grace, and rejoice
in his coming. The books tell us that the beasts who drink
of the stream where carbuncles have been washed, are
cured of their malady; and the wretched who in good
faith look at this stone are comforted and forget their
adversity. By the virtue which God has sent, it soothes
the eyes, comforts the heart and the body, and gives man
lordship more than do those stones which are larger. Carbuncles
are found in Libya in the river of paradise. The
book of Moses says that God commanded that the carbuncle
should be first in the second row of twelve stones.
By night and by day it illumines all, and restores and
lightens the heart. Sunlight does not take away any of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>great and joy-giving color. Moses tells us that it signifies
Jesus Christ, who came into the world to lighten our darkness,
and Saint John, speaking of the coming of Jesus
Christ, said He is the true Light who gives light to all
men and to all the world. Isaiah the prophet said of Him
that the people who walked in darkness have seen a great
Light. Saint John did not find the carbuncle among the
foundations of the celestial kingdom of Jerusalem, for all
who desire to behold the carbuncle and the clearness of
the true sun must turn to the true light of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Twelve stones there are in this world which have great
significance. I shall not fail briefly to say what each one
signifies. Red jasper signifies love; the green, faith; the
white, sweetness. Sapphire means that he who has faith
shall reign together with God. Chalcedony, which is the
color of fire, shows who will be neighbors with God.
Emerald signifies the faith which the Christians have in
Him; sardonyx, chastity and humility among the saints;
sardius, the sorrows which they had on earth for their
love of God; chrysolite, the life celestial that they have
after the life terrestrial; beryl, purification, which the
saints pronounce to the people. Topaz signifies to us the
crown of holy life; chrysoprase, the reward which holy
men will hold very dear; and jacinth is a sign of the
light which the saints have from the Creator. Amethyst
shows the martyrdom which God suffered.</p>

<p>It is forbidden a clerk in orders to perform or to see
miracle plays, for they are sinful gatherings and sights.
He may, in church, play the resurrection, showing how
God rose, and thus make men believe faithfully that
Christ rose in flesh and blood, and he may play without
harm the part showing how God was born in Yule night,
and thus teach men to believe steadfastly that Christ was
born of the Virgin Mary. If he plays parts in the streets
or in groves, it seems truly a sinful sight. Saint Isidore
bears witness to this, for he says, "These men forsake
what they accepted,—God and Christianity, when they take
part in such things as miracle plays or in games or tournaments
of great price." These are pomps that thou didst
forsake when thou didst accept Christianity. At the font
the ignorant man says, "I forsake thee, here, Satan, and
all thy pomps and thy works." This is the instruction thou
hast had as a clerk. Hast thou kept thy promise when
thou dost take part in such performances? Thou hast
broken thy covenant with God, and dost serve thy sire,
Termagant. Saint Isidore says in his writings, "All those
who delight in seeing such things, or who lend horse or
harness for them, are perilously guilty." If a priest or a
clerk lends a vestment which has been hallowed by the
sacrament, he, more than others, is to be blamed, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>shall have the infamy which attends sacrilege, and shall
be chastised as is right.</p>

<p>Dances, carols, and summer games bring shame in
many ways; when thou dost plan to take part in these
thou art slothful in God's service, and shalt be punished
for thy sin.</p>

<p>What say you of minstrels, all of whom delight in such
things? Their deeds are full of peril, and dear neither to
God nor to God's house. They would rather hear of a dance
or of deeds of boasting and of pride than any good of God
in heaven, or other wisdom that may be named. In folly
is spent all that they get,—on their dress, their drink,
and their meat. And because of such things, I shall tell
you what once befell a minstrel. Saint Gregory tells this
story:</p>

<p>A minstrel, a goliardys,<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> came once to a bishop's house,
and asked for charity. The porter let him enter. At meal
time the board was laid; and when the benison should
have been said, this minstrel made melody with music
loud and high. By report, the bishop was a holy man.
He sat down at the table, and should have blessed the
food, with a word, but he was so disturbed by the noise of
the minstrelsy that he did not say grace, as he usually did,
very devoutly.</p>

<p>The bishop complained sorely, and said to all those who
were there that he would not put the benison above the
grace of charity. He saw well, in spirit, that vengeance
was approaching speedily, and said, "Give him his alms,
and let him go. Death approaches, which will slay him."
The minstrel received charity, and then departed, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>he passed out of the gate, a stone fell down from the wall,
and slew him there. That betokened that God was not
pleased with what the minstrel did, when he disturbed the
devotion of the good man.</p>

<p>This is told for the sake of gleemen, so that they will
take some heed as to where it is proper to make music,
and also for the sake of those who listen, so that they will
not love minstrelsy too dearly, nor have for it such affection
that they will worship heaven's King the less.</p>

<p>I shall tell you what I have heard of this bishop, Saint
Robert, whose surname is Grossteste of Lincoln. He loved
to hear the harp, for it makes the wit of man keen. Next
his chamber, beside his study, was his harper's chamber.
Many times, by night and by day, he found solace in notes
and lays. Some one asked him why he had such delight
in minstrelsy, and he told why he held the harper dear:
"The virtue of the harp will destroy the fiend's might,
and rightly the harp is likened to the cross. Another thing
comforts me,—if God has given to a piece of wood the
power to make men hear so much joy, even more joy,
there must be where God Himself dwells. The harp often
reminds me of the joy and bliss where God is. Therefore,
good men, you should learn when you hear a gleeman,
to worship God with all your might, according as David
says in the Psalter, 'in harp, in tabor, and in symphony,
worship God; in trumpets and psaltery, in stringed instruments
and organs, and in bells ringing, in all these worship
heaven's King.' If you do thus, I say boldly, you
may hear your minstrelsy."</p>

<h3 title="THE LAND OF COCKAYGNE">THE LAND OF COCKAYGNE<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a></h3>


<p>Far in the sea west of Spain is a land called Cockaygne.
There is no land except the kingdom of heaven its equal
in happiness and goodness; though paradise is joyful and
bright, Cockaygne is still fairer. What is there in paradise
but grass and flowers and green branches? Though joy
and great pleasure are in paradise, yet there is no food
but fruit; there is no hall, no bower, no bench, and nothing
but water to quench one's thirst. Only two men live there,
Enoch and Elias; a wretched life must they lead where no
other men dwell.</p>

<p>In Cockaygne is meat and drink, without care or trouble
or toil. The meat is dainty; the drink is pure wine at noon
and at supper. This land has no peer on earth; verily
there is no place under heaven so full of joy and bliss.</p>

<p>In that land is many a sweet sight; it is always day and
never night; there is no strife nor quarrel; there is no
death, but only lasting life; there is no lack of food nor
dress; there is no angry man nor woman; there is no serpent,
wolf, nor fox, horse nor colt, ox nor cow; there is no
sheep nor swine nor goat nor steed nor stables. There
are no flies nor fleas nor other insects in town or bed or
house, no serpents nor snails, nor is there thunder, sleet,
nor hail, storm, rain, nor wind; there is no blind man nor
woman, but everywhere is jest and joy and glee. Well
fares it with him who there may dwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Rivers flow there, wide and fair, of oil, of milk, of
honey, and of wine. Water serves there only two uses,—to
look at, and to use for washing. There are many kinds
of fruit, and everywhere is solace and delight.</p>

<p>There is a fair abbey of white monks and of gray; there
are bowers and halls; the walls are all of pasties, of flesh,
of fish, and of rich meats,—the very best a man may eat.
Flour cakes are the shingles of church, cloister, bower,
and hall. The pinnacles are fat puddings, rich food for
princes and kings; men may eat as much as they please,
without any danger. All things are in common to both
old and young, to strong and weak, to meek and bold.</p>

<p>There is a cloister fair and light, broad and long and
beautiful. All the pillars of that cloister are of crystal,
with bases and capitals of green jasper and red coral. In
the meadow is a tree, most pleasing to the sight. The
root is ginger and galingale; the shoots are all of zedoary;
the finest maces are the flowers; the rind is sweet smelling
cinnamon; and the fruit is clove of goodly taste. Cubebs
are not lacking, either. There are roses red of hue, and
lilies, also, fair to see. They never fade by day nor by
night, this should be a pleasant sight. There are four
wells in the abbey, made of triacle and aromatic plants, of
balm and also of spiced wine, ever fed by underground
streams. Precious stones and gold are there, sapphire,
pearl, carbuncle, astrion, emerald, liguros and chrysoprase,
beryl, onyx and topaz, amethyst and chrysolite, chalcedony
and epetite. There are many birds,—the throstle, thrush,
and nightingale, the lark and the woodpecker, and other
birds without number, that never cease singing merrily
day nor night.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>More, however, there is to tell you; geese roasted on
the spit fly to that abbey and cry: "Geese, all hot, all
hot." They bring plenty of garlick, the best you could
ever look for. The larks, that are familiar food, light in a
man's mouth, all stewed daintily and powdered with clove
and cinnamon. There is never any question of drink, but
every one takes enough, yet does not toil.</p>

<p>When the monks go to mass, all the glass windows
turn to bright crystal, to give the monks more light.
When the masses are all said, the crystal turns again to
glass, in the state that it was before.... [The rest of
the poem satirizes the morals of the monks.]</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3><a href="#i_frontis">Frontispiece.</a></h3><p>"Last Judgment" is an early work by Fra
Angelico (1387-1455), who was a member of the Dominican order, and
who spent his monastic leisure in painting visionary scenes. The picture
represents Christ on the judgment seat, encircled by cherubim
and seraphim, with saints and apostles seated on either side. Below
are open graves. On His left devils are driving sinners into hideous
torments; on His right angels are conducting the blessed across the
flowery meadows of the earthly paradise toward the gleaming gates of
the celestial city. The detail given here is sometimes called "The Dance
of the Angels." The robes of the angelic beings who go singing and
caroling are in the colors characteristic of Fra Angelico,—azure, green,
and rose, irradiated by countless golden stars.</p>


<h3><a name="PROEM_notes" id="PROEM_notes"></a>PROEM</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Of Man's Body. Of Man's Soul</span></h4>

<p>This introductory bit of mediæval lore is translated from "Cursor
Mundi" (Over-runner of the World), a long poem, probably written in
the early fourteenth century. The author says plainly at the beginning
of his work that he is vying with romances and other secular tales
which draw the thoughts of men away from spiritual matters. The
poem, written in 24,000 verses in the short couplet, tells the history of
the seven ages of the world, from the Creation to Doomsday, covering
very much the same matter as that presented in the miracle plays. The
"Cursor Mundi" has been edited by R. Morris for the Early English
Text Society. Lines 511-584 are here translated.</p>


<h3><a name="DEBATE_notes" id="DEBATE_notes"></a>DEBATE</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Amorous Contention of Phillis and Flora</span></h4>

<p>"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Phillide et Flora</span>," a Latin poem of the twelfth century, perhaps,
was translated about 1595 by George Chapman. In 1598 a certain
"R. S." republished this translation with a few minor changes, but the
work is essentially Chapman's. The present reprint follows the text in
Thomas Wright's "Latin Poems commonly attributed to Walter Mapes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Camden Society, Vol. <abbr title="16">XVI</abbr>. London, 1841. The translation reproduces
the stanza and rime form of the original. Although the Elizabethan
language may present some difficulties, they are not very serious to
any one who will read slowly enough to enjoy "the proud full sail of
his great verse" who may have been the rival of Shakespeare, and
who was certainly one of the inspirers of John Keats.</p>

<p>The poem itself is of significance because, as forerunner of poems
of the order of "The Romance of the Rose," it illustrates significant
mediæval traits. The attitude towards nature, classicism, love, war, and
learning is of great interest, and so, too, is the position of women in
that sophisticated world. The disputation gives a pretty picture of the
seriousness of feminine thought. The account of the court of the god
of love and the power ascribed to him are a good introduction to the
conventions of love poetry.</p>

<p>Readers of Theocritus will recall how his shepherds contend in song
over the charms of their beloved maidens, in Idyll <abbr title="5">V</abbr> and elsewhere.
(See Lang's translation, The Macmillan Company, New York, 1889.)
A study of the evolution of the debate, or disputation, will prove a
good introduction to the world of late classical and of mediæval literature.
There are many examples of debate, such as those between "The
Heart and the Eye," "The Body and the Soul," "The Water and the
Wine," "The Owl and the Nightingale," "The Thrush and the Nightingale,"
"The Debate of the Carpenter's Tools," "The Dispute between
Mary and the Cross," and many others. Birds, flowers, animals, inanimate
objects, human beings, and even virtuous abstractions were turned
into mediæval disputants.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Rose_and_Violet_notes" id="Rose_and_Violet_notes"></a>The Pleading of the Rose and of the Violet</span></h4>

<p>Jean Froissart (1338-1410) was a distinguished French author who
is best known for the famous "Chronicles of England, France, and
Spain," which picture with extraordinary vividness scenes which Froissart
actually witnessed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1392, probably, Froissart wrote his "Plaidorie<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"> de la Rose et de la
Violette</span>," which is here translated from his "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Poésies</span>," edited in three
volumes, with an excellent introduction, by A. Scheler, Brussels, 1872.
The value of his poetical works lies in their revelation of the literary
taste of the court and of the fashionable world of the day, for he employed
the artificial sentiment and the conventional forms of dream and
allegory very pleasantly. The Plaidorie is not a famous poem, but it is
chosen because it serves to illustrate a combination of various important
traits. It is one of the many mediæval poems in which the flower <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</i>
is preëminent. Here Froissart introduces rather charming personifications,
especially significant in the case of the fleur-de-lys, the national
flower of France. In spite of the trivial and sentimental attitude towards
nature there are many passages of genuine feeling. The poem should be

where the cult of the daisy is represented. Valuable aids to this study

<p>Furthermore, the jesting mockery of legal procedure should be noted.
Chaucer's "Fortune" employs legal phraseology, and although Froissart's
poem may never have been known to Chaucer, the use of the
terms and the associations of law was frequent among poets. Readers
of Shakespeare's "Sonnets" will recall his use of legal imagery, but of
course he was uninfluenced by this poem.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Purgatory of Saint Patrick</span></h4>

<p>This translation is a free rendering of a poem found in the famous
Auchinleck manuscript, a collection of popular poetry copied in the
fourteenth century. A description of this manuscript will be found in
Scott's edition of "Sir Tristem." The poem is in the six-line, tail-rime
stanza which was much used in romances of the day. There are other
versions of this legend in Latin, in French, and in English. Because
of its detail, this version, of the late thirteenth century, edited by
E. Koelbing in <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Englische Studien</cite>, <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, 98, has been chosen, although
in some respects it is inferior in style to the other English versions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>Especially interesting is the picture of the earthly paradise, which is
nowhere else described so fully as it is here by catalogues and other
means. As an introduction to mediæval religious beliefs the poem is
almost unequaled. Pilgrimages, even to this day, are made, by the faithful,
to Lough Derg, in Ireland, where Saint Patrick's Purgatory is still
continuing its saving grace.</p>

<p>Students of comparative literature recognize in the story a body of
tradition reaching back into remote times and forward to the Renaissance,
finding its most perfect expression in Dante's "Divine Comedy"
(1321). Mediæval descriptions of hell and heaven were made more vivid
by adopting the literary form known as the <i>vision</i>. The most familiar
sort of vision is that which describes things seen in a dream, after the
author has fallen asleep. "The Pilgrim's Progress" is an example of
this type. Another sort of vision is that which relates what has been
perceived by some one in a state of mystical exaltation, as in the
Apocalypse of Saint John. The most realistic form of vision is that of
"Saint Patrick's Purgatory," where the experiences are described as if
actually undergone, and yet they so transcend human probability that
the reader recognizes the apocalyptic element. The term "vision" is
usually applied to poems describing mysteries of religious or moral
truth, and "dream" is applied to secular works such as "The Romance
of the Rose," and many other popular poems. Examples of
visions from various epochs should be read in order to trace the history.

<h3><a name="SAINTS_LIVES_notes" id="SAINTS_LIVES_notes"></a>SAINTS' LIVES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Brandon_notes" id="Brandon_notes"></a>The Life of Saint Brandon</span></h4>

<p>Brandon, Brendon, or Brandan, was an Irish Odysseus whose journeyings
in search of the Land of Behest have a lasting fascination for all
lovers of romantic adventure. The atmosphere of sanctity which made
this legend approved reading for the mediæval Christian gives a quaint
irony to the accounts of fairies, demons, enchanted birds, and other
marvels which betray a frankly superstitious spirit. Travelers' records
have a distinct place in literature, as the names Ohthere, Marco Polo,
Mandeville, Hakluyt, Robinson Crusoe, Stevenson, Hearn and many
others prove, and when the voyage is undertaken because of mingled
love of excitement, passion for the sea, zeal for discovery, and deep
longing to find the ideal land, it has potent appeal to those who stay at
home. In almost every language there are tales which picture an earthly
paradise. The Fortunate Isles, the Garden of the Hesperides, Calypso's
Isle, Avalon, Hy Brasail, Tir-na'n-Og, are names given in Greek and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Celtic story to the abode of those who have won release from earthly
cares and hardship, and have entered the realm of perfect terrestrial
peace and beauty.</p>

<p>The translation is William Caxton's version of the life of Brandon
based upon some source not yet satisfactorily determined. Caxton's
rather rambling but most charming rendering was included in "The
Golden Legend," mentioned below.</p>

based, and much other material relating to this theme, will be found in

the story of Sindbad, in "The Arabian Nights."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Margaret_notes" id="Margaret_notes"></a>The Life of Saint Margaret</span></h4>

<p>Jacobus de Voragine (1230-1298), Archbishop of Genoa, was the
author of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Historia Lombardica seu Legenda Sanctorum</span>," popularly
known as "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Legenda Aurea</span>." When William Caxton set up his printing
press and began to multiply copies of the English classics, he included
among his publications an English rendering of the Latin text, "The
Golden Legend," (1483), which he based upon a French translation.
The present version is from Caxton's text, as printed in the Temple
Classics.</p>

<p>The great popularity of lives of the saints is due partly to that trait,
inherent in human nature, of genuine devotion to any one of proved
courage, especially when that courage is of the spirit, an invincible religious
faith and fortitude. Weak and unstable Christians found inspiration
in these saintly lives, and by continued meditation learned many
lessons of deep meaning. But, in addition to the ethical interest, there
was sympathy for the human experiences and the strange and fearful
adventures of these elect of the Lord. As the metrical romances ministered
to popular delight in knightly deeds, so, too, these legends of the
saints satisfied the world-old love of struggle and of victory. Saint
Margaret, Saint Katherine, Saint Juliana, were the women saints whose
lives were best known to the Middle Ages, but the many legendaries
of the day gave ample record of scores of other saints.</p>

<p>For versions of the life of Saint Margaret, see Early English Text
Society, No. 13. "The Golden Legend" in seven volumes (Temple
Classics, E. P. Dutton and Company, New York) contains the fullest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>collection of lives of the saints. Middle English collections have been
edited by Carl Horstmann. Fox's "Book of Martyrs" should be
remembered, also.</p>


<h3><a name="PIOUS_TALES_notes" id="PIOUS_TALES_notes"></a>PIOUS TALES</h3>

<p>The superstitions of the Middle Ages reveal themselves very fully in
the various accounts of miracles performed by God, Christ, the Virgin,
the saints, or by the relics treasured in churches and religious houses.
The study of mediæval religious life must include an examination of
some of these fervent and naïve records of the supernatural power of
holy objects and holy folk. The intense reverence accorded to sanctified
things created, among mediæval Christians, a passionate disregard
for the dictates of human reason. At first this blind faith and total
abasement before sacred relics was a triumph of the spirit, but before
long it became a triumph of the body, for physical well-being and
material prosperity were sought rather than spiritual enlightenment. In
Chaucer's Pardoner's "Prologue" and in Erasmus's account of his
journeys to Walsingham and to Canterbury one finds pictured the
credulous and wholly unlovely side of the subject. When idealism declines
and becomes sheer bigotry, without the charm of imaginative
power, it must have its Wiclif and its Luther.</p>

<h3><a name="ALLEGORY_notes" id="ALLEGORY_notes"></a>ALLEGORY</h3>

<p>The popularity of allegory, in the Middle Ages, as a means of conveying
religious and moral truth, led to the production of many very
complex narratives and sermons. An acquaintance with "Piers Plowman"
will reveal the character of these works where the reader is soon
lost in the labyrinth of abstract names. "The Romance of the Rose,"
translated by F. S. Ellis (Temple Classics, 3 vols., E. P. Dutton &amp;
Company, New York), is the most important example of secular allegory
in the Middle Ages. "The Order of Chivalry," a poem that defines the
symbolism of the knightly habit, will be found in Miss Butler's "Tales
from the Old French," Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1910, and
also (as "Sir Hugh of Tabarie") in E. Mason's "Aucassin and Nicolette
and Other Mediæval Romances" (Everyman's Library, E. P.
Dutton &amp; Company, New York, 1909).</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap"><a name="Castle_notes" id="Castle_notes"></a>The Castle of Love</span>"</h4>

<p>This extract from a long and very complex poem illustrates significant
aspects of mediæval religious allegory. The poem itself was written
in French by Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln (who died in 1253),
and was translated into English several times because of its great popularity.
Beginning with an account of the Creation and of the Fall of
Man, the poet went on to tell a parable of a Being who had one Son,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>His equal in all ways, four daughters (named Mercy, Truth, Right, and
Peace), and a thrall (named Adam), who was in prison. Mercy and
Peace pleaded for the thrall's releases, but Truth and Right objected, so
the thrall was punished. Mercy and Peace fled from the land, and the
world (except Noah and his family) was drowned. Peace once more
appealed for the ransom of the thrall, and the King's Son, hearing the
dispute of the four sisters, said He would put on the garments of the
thrall and force Peace and Right to be reconciled, and the world would
be saved. So Christ entered into the Castle of Love, and was born on
earth for the redemption of mankind. An account of the life and passion
and resurrection of Christ is given, and the poem concludes with a prayer
that we may all be led by Him to everlasting bliss.</p>

version by a monk of Sawley, in Yorkshire. The present extract is
taken from the Sawley monk's translation (ll. 361-452) because that
version gives the allegory in more coherent and careful detail than do
the other versions, which fail to explain some of the symbolism.</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lion</span>, <span class="smcap">Eagle</span>, <span class="smcap">Whale</span>, <span class="smcap">Siren</span></h4>

<p>From earliest times animals have been employed as symbolic figures
by teachers and preachers, and the interest of the present day in animal
life and lore is evidence of the never-failing pleasure humanity finds in
beast books. Æsop's "Fables," "The Little Flowers of Saint Francis,"
"Reynard the Fox," and "The Jungle Stories" illustrate various sides
of the literature about the lesser folk. The mediæval bestiary was a book
which sought to enunciate religious instruction by an appeal to the curiosity
of credulous people. The didactic interest far exceeded the scientific
in these allegories which, to us, are most diverting matter. The
source of the bestiary is to be found in the Greek "Physiologus"
(second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>), which was translated into Latin by Theobaldus
in the late Middle Ages, and then into other languages. In Old English
literature "The Whale" and "The Panther" and a fragment of "The
Partridge" are all that remain of the version in that language. The
Middle English bestiary of the thirteenth century contains descriptions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>followed by explication, of the lion, the eagle, the adder, the ant, the
hart, the fox, the spider, the whale, the siren, the elephant, the turtle
dove, the panther, and the culver. There is a French bestiary written
in England by Philippe de Thaün, about 1120, which contains a portion
of a lapidary also. A translation is in T. Wright's "Popular Treatises
on Science written during the Middle Ages." London, 1841.</p>

<h3><a name="LAPIDARY_notes" id="LAPIDARY_notes"></a>LAPIDARY</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Selections from Lapidaries</span></h4>

<p>Marbodus, Bishop of Rennes in the twelfth century, was the author
of the lapidary which was best known during the Middle Ages. This
book, called "De Gemmis," was written in Latin verse, and gives
the strange superstitions about the virtues and efficacies of sixty
stones. Many of these stones are now unknown to us. There was so
much interest in this lapidary that it was frequently translated into
French, both in verse form and in prose, and was popular in England
as well as in France. The traditions about stones developed two sorts
of treatise: one in which the purely pagan beliefs are represented, as
they were handed down by Aristotle, Pliny, Marbodus, and others; and
a second in which the pagan superstitions are inwrought with Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>teachings and associated with Scriptural passages. In translating Marbodus,
a Christian clerk would add and alter material in such a way as
to impress religious symbolisms upon his readers, through the popular
interest in all the lore of stones.</p>

<p>Information regarding the lapidaries, as well as editions of various
French and other lapidaries, will be found in the following books:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The accounts of diamond, sapphire, amethyst, geratite, chelidonius,
coral, heliotrope, pearl, and pantheros are translated from a French
prose version of the Latin of Marbodus. The French translation was
made, perhaps, in England during the twelfth century. The text will
be found in Meyer, pp. 271-285. The French prose lapidary has been
chosen rather than that in verse form, because it has fewer tags and
circumlocutions, and can be more faithfully rendered into English.</p>

<p>The diamond, or adamant, was a favorite stone. "The Travels of Sir
John Mandeville," pp. 105-108, The Macmillan Company, New York,
1905, has an interesting account of this.</p>

<p>The pearl has been the subject of much discussion. The present
translation omits several lines in the French version which do not appear
in Marbodus and which seem to be due to confusion with another
stone. Consult Kunz and Stevenson's "The Book of the Pearl," The
Century Company, New York, 1908, and pp. 599-610 of Schofield's
article "Symbolism, Allegory, and Autobiography in The Pearl."
<cite>Publications of the Modern Language Association</cite>, Vol. <abbr title="17">XVII</abbr>.</p>

<p>The extract describing the carbuncle is from Pannier, p. 295, where a
prose fragment of a Christian lapidary is given. The carbuncle was frequently
mentioned in mediæval romances, and was supposed to give
success in battle, and also in lawsuits (see Meyer, p. 67).</p>

<p>The account of the symbolism of the twelve stones comes from
Philippe de Thaün's "Bestiaire," verses 2977-3004. The Oxford Bible
gives classified lists of stones mentioned in the Scriptures.</p>

<h3><a name="HOMILY_notes" id="HOMILY_notes"></a>HOMILY</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Concerning Miracle Plays, Games, and Minstrelsy</span></h4>

<p>Homilies in prose and in verse were a common means of instruction.
They were usually more popular than mere sermons and sought to hold
the attention by the use of copious illustration. The following extract
is from "Handlyng Synne" (Manual of Sins), translated in 1303 by
Robert Mannyng of Brunne, from a French original, and edited by
Dr. Furnivall, Early English Text Society, No. 119. "Handlyng Synne,"
a collection of homilies, denounces the seven deadly sins, citing many
concrete instances of fact and of fable in order to enforce the moral
lessons. The translation below interprets lines 4637-4774 (pp. 155-159),
where the sin of sloth is under discussion.</p>

<h3><a name="SATIRE_notes" id="SATIRE_notes"></a>SATIRE</h3>

<p>The most popular satire in the Middle Ages is found in the fabliaux,
short tales which picture, with great zest, racy incidents in the lives of
common people whose hidden sins or hypocrisies are suddenly exposed.
The satire in these stories is exceedingly broad and attacks,
by preference, women and the clergy, painting with vivid realism their
immorality and intense selfishness. Readers will find information regarding
these in "The English Fabliau," by H. S. Canby, <cite>Publications
of the Modern Language Association</cite>, <abbr title="21">XXI</abbr>, 200-214. Formal satire,
which points out abuses and vices by means of exposition, is illustrated
in the poems following. Satire against women is most agreeably
found in "The Romance of the Rose," chaps. <abbr title="46">xlvi</abbr>-<abbr title="52">lii</abbr> (translated
by F. S. Ellis, Temple Classics). In <cite>Romania</cite>, <abbr title="15">XV</abbr>, 315, 339; <abbr title="16">XVI</abbr>,

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Paris_notes" id="Paris_notes"></a>The Song of the University of Paris</span></h4>

<p>This is freely translated from the French poem of Rutebeuf, written
in octosyllabic couplets, about the middle of the thirteenth century.
Rutebeuf was a famous minstrel whose vivid wit gave him a distinguished
place among mediæval writers. His works are full of autobiographical
details; he pictured his unhappy domestic life, his poverty,
all his failings, and his virtues with an engaging frankness. In allegory
he was a master of the mannerisms of his day. In satire he was original
and clever. The monastic orders aroused his fiercest resentment, and
he made sharp epigrams at their expense, accusing them of committing
the seven deadly sins and more. The dry incisiveness of his ridicule
may have impressed Chaucer and also the author of "Piers Plowman,"
although we have no proof of this. A very good study of Rutebeuf
has been published by L. Cledat, Paris, 1891. The description of
the mediæval student gives a true picture of the day, but Chaucer's
description of the Clerk of Oxford should be read as complement. For

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Cockaygne_notes" id="Cockaygne_notes"></a>The Land of Cockaygne</span></h4>

<p>The meaning of <i>Cockaygne</i> is usually understood to be "cookery." This
satire upon the mediæval monks was probably derived from a French
original. It illustrates the contemptuous tolerance of that day for the
greed, the gluttony, the slothfulness, and the immorality of the inmates
of the monastery. The satire directed against literary conventions of the
day is particularly amusing, if we notice how the various catalogues of
animals, birds, spices, flowers, jewels, and food parody similar catalogues
in the romances and in the poems describing paradise. The
poem was written, in the short couplet, about the middle of the thirteenth
century. It is printed in E. Maetzner's "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Altenglische Sprachproben</span>,"
I, 148. Berlin, 1867. Wright's "<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick's Purgatory,"
London, 1844, contains an interesting chapter on this and similar
burlesques.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Husbandman_notes" id="Husbandman_notes"></a>The Complaint of the Husbandman</span></h4>

<p>This "complaint," or "song," was written during the thirteenth century
when the persecutions of the poor farmers by lords and their officers
were most extreme. The poem explains very fully the various
abuses which finally so incensed the poor that they rose in revolt and
won certain rights from their oppressors. The Middle English text is
found in K. Boeddeker's "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Altenglische Dichtungen</span>," p. 102, Berlin,
1878, and in T. Wright's "Political Songs," Camden Society, Vol. <abbr title="6">VI</abbr>,
p. 149.</p>

<p>The meter and rime of the original have been kept, in this translation,
even at the risk of a few very slight changes in the order or in the
phrasing of the original, because the versification is so illustrative of
the transition from the old alliterative line to the elaborate stanza forms
of the French period.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="Sir_Penny_notes" id="Sir_Penny_notes"></a>Sir Penny</span></h4>

<p>This satire was evidently a popular one in the Middle Ages; it is
found in various forms in Latin, in French, and in English. The following
translation is made from a version, probably of about 1350,
printed in Thomas Wright's "Latin Poems attributed to Walter
Mapes," Camden Society, Vol. <abbr title="16">XVI</abbr>, pp. 359-361. The poem is written
in the six-line, tail-rime stanza of "Sir Thopas," and the translation
seeks to preserve the cadences, movement, and structure of the original.
It is interesting in connection with "Piers Plowman" and "The
Pardoner's Tale," for it shows the great superiority of those satires,
in imaginative appeal. The generalizations here are faithful, but they
lack point and effectiveness because they do not drive home specific
instances about individuals. We have a personal interest in Lady Meed
and in the Pardoner, but we care little about classes and types.</p>


<h3><a name="LAY_notes" id="LAY_notes"></a>LAY</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sir Orfeo</span></h4>

<p>This Middle English version of a French lay seems to offer so few
difficulties that it is given in its original form, as it appears in the
Auchinleck manuscript. The text is copied from that edited by Laing
in "Select Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland," reprinted
in Edinburgh, 1884. A critical edition of the poem was published by
O. Zielke, Breslau, 1880. A very charming free translation in stanza
form has been made by E. E. Hunt, Cambridge, 1909.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sir Orfeo" is the mediæval interpretation of the story of Orpheus
and Eurydice (Ovid's "Metamorphoses," bk. <abbr title="10">x</abbr>, ll. 1-77), which was told
in French, and then translated by some nameless but immortal English
poet. The beauty of this Middle English version is undeniable. Despite
its brevity and its occasionally laconic phrases, the poem shows
real pathos in the account of the passionate grief of Orfeo, and his
desolate wanderings in search of his lady. The concrete vividness of
color and fragrance in nature, the dim stateliness of the retinue of the king
of fairyland, the magic beauty of his strange abode, are described with
true poetic sensitiveness. In choice of detail, in management of incident,
in "discovery," and in conclusion the narrative is singularly well managed.</p>

<p>As a mediæval rendering of a classical tale, the poem has many
charms, because it so naïvely and so completely changes the setting
and insists upon mediæval towers and dress and customs. Pluto's dark
realm is transformed into a fairy kingdom, Thrace has become Winchester,
and the wandering Greek is a Breton harper knocking at the
door of a Gothic castle. As a version of one of the most beautiful of
the world's stories, this lay has true imaginative distinction; it pictures
the loyalty of love and love's power over time and fairy spells, but it
willfully changes the outcome of the old story to suit the sentiment of
high romance in an age when every tale must have a happy ending.</p>

<p>Other lays, or brief tales, are described in W. H. Schofield's "English
Literature from the Norman Conquest to Chaucer," p. 179. The
Macmillan Company, New York, 1906. "Launfal," a lay of fairyland,
is one of the most beautiful. The lays of Marie de France are accessible
in the following translations:</p>

<p>In translating the poem the student should pronounce all the unknown
words aloud and he will speedily recognize resemblances to modern
words. <i>Y</i> is the pronoun "I," but sometimes it is part of the past participle,—<i>y-hold</i>
= "held." <i>Ich</i> is "I," and also "each." Frequently a
pronoun and a verb are combined, as <i>ichil</i> = "I will"; <i>wiltow</i> = "wilt
thou"; sometimes the negative particle is combined with a verb, as in
<i>nis</i> = "is not"; <i>nil</i> = "will not." <i>Owhen</i> = "own"; <i>yif</i> = "if." It is
assumed that readers will recognize the words used in the ballads or in
Spenser's works. If there are words which are not recognized they can
be found in the New English Dictionary, or in the New International
Dictionary, or in Bradley and Stratmann's Middle English Dictionary.</p>
